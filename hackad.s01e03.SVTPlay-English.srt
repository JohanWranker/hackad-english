1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,720
"Let's do this."

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,560
-Should this be on? Yeah, think so?

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,080
I record all calls, so we have extra backup if this gives up.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,440
A large part of crime has moved online:

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,680
Everything from simple, small scams to serious organized crime.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,960
Oh yeah. These are the awesome. They look good. These are our cameras.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,760
It's no longer teenagers who do things just because you can–

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,200
- but criminal elements.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,640
This is also a camera. I'm so equipped now.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,920
The security company Gunnebo has been attacked.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,560
Is the camera running?

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,960
So I don't go in, and then just ... panic.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,200
SVT has let four professional hackers attack individuals–

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,320
and companies, to show how vulnerable we are in our connected society.

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,480
Organized crime has moved online.

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,800
Coop had to close almost all of its 800 stores.

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,400
Serious cyberattacks increases every year–

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,280
And huge ransoms are paid to save companies from ruin.

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,200
Can our hackers access big business via a secret shortcut?

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,480
/ CALL SIGNAL /

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm terrified they'll be suspicious and call the police.

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,760
are you nervous, Jinny?

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,720
Our hackers are playing criminals.

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,640
In two days they have to infiltrate the IT company Langate.

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Jesper and Jinny are using Social manipulation,

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,240
- to be let in to the company to gain a foothold.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,000
No one there, except the CEO, knows about the hack.

28
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,880
Jinny is dressed as a worker and will say she has to check humidity.

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,720
They have made a "cover story" where her name is Frida.

30
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:02,040
They have a website for Flexvatten, the company she's from.

31
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,800
I'll park here. It's good if we're not seen.

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,040
- We can stop here. -Yeah, thinking about that too.

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,080
The risk is they'll call the police.

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,920
That they catch you, become suspicious and keep you there.

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,320
In reality, this had been a fairly serious crime.

36
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,680
Anyone who wants to attack several companies can target a supplier -

37
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,480
- a so-called supply chain attack.

38
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,080
Langate is small with many customers. If the hackers manage to infiltrate them–

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,080
- then the opportunity to access a large number of companies is opened.

40
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,640
The last few meters ... I didn't check the heart monitor, but it was probably high.

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,720
I got really nervous.

42
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,400
Hey! I'm here to measure some moisture in your walls.

43
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,400
- From Sölvesborgs Construction, or? -Yes. Or from Sölvesborg municipality.

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,080
Is it okay?

45
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,360
We humans have a tendency to fill in the blanks -

46
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,960
-If someone seems to fit in a role.

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,280
If you look like an IT technician, then you probably are.

48
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,400
-Where do you the kitchen and ...? - The kitchen is in there.

49
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,800
-Bathroom? -There.

50
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,160
If you look like you belong in an environment, we assume you do.

51
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,360
We may not stop a person and ask to see the ID -

52
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,200
-Or look closely and realize that the ID is fake.

53
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,000
The world's thickest wall is useless if someone opens a door in it.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,840
I looked for cables in the ceiling and for a cable to a TV

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
-But there was nothing, so we concluded that they ran everything on wifi.

56
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,440
And we had not prepped for that.

57
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
She's been inside for 15 minutes so far.

58
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,320
I felt that I had to go one more round.

59
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:01,280
Then I saw a door. I went straight in as if I knew what was there.

60
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,520
There was a switch - network equipment - and some type of server

61
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,120
-With lights flashing.

62
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,080
So it was a gold mine, just what I were looking for.

63
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,280
Fast as hell, take up everything, plug in, plug in power ...

64
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,480
Jinny?

65
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,160
Something is happening.

66
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Out through door and pretend to write. I wrote on the paper all the way out.

67
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,080
- Did you go out, Jinny? -Yes.

68
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,760
Did you plug it in? Do you know that you got a link?

69
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,600
- It flashed. - It hasn't come up yet.

70
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,560
Forget it. It came up! It's up. Yes, we have contact!

71
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,360
Holy shit!

72
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,960
Oh! How fucking nervous I was.

73
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,480
So fucking good!

74
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,280
Like, fuck.

75
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,240
The glasses were foggy all the time.

76
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,240
She's a fucking hero. I'm on a parking lot, so I'll pull away.

77
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,080
Feel free to start Responder in analyze mode, right away.

78
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,880
There's a risk that he ... When I said what wanted to do, he paused.

79
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,000
It feels like I've done something bad, and we have.

80
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,200
At the end of 2020 there was a major supply chain attack

81
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,600
- against the security company Solarwinds.

82
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,880
In the attack, malicious code was spread to Solarwind's customers -

83
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,000
–For instance the US military and several other security companies.

84
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,000
In Sweden, e.g. Volvo Cars, Skanska and Space Agency.

85
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,400
The US Treasury Department pointed out Russia as responsible for the attack.

86
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm so fucking ... almost vomiting now,  ... of adrenaline.

87
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,960
How do we start the conversation? Only: "Hello, we want to hack your business."

88
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,000
While Linus is investigating the company from the inside -

89
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,520
- they meet with the company's CEO to discuss the assignment.

90
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,400
The CEO does not know that the hackers have jumpstarted.

91
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,680
- Wanna have lunch and talk? -Yes, we should do that.

92
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,280
Nobody at Langate knows this.

93
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,400
No one on the staff, no one knows that this will be done.

94
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,680
I do not know the details myself, but now I'm going to be hacked.

95
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,680
"Good luck." But not too much "luck".

96
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,480
We at Langate know that we may be the victim of a hacker attack -

97
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,640
-To access our customers.

98
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,720
- We want to create as good protection as we can. -Because you become the most sensitive part.

99
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,520
Yes, we will be the service provider supply chain to others.

100
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,960
Potentially, one could reach–

101
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,520
-About a hundred customers important information.

102
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,880
-Or make do ransomware attack ... -Some kind of malicious code.

103
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,440
Or just access information that you see has an incredible business value.

104
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,440
I had an experience this weekend. A customer who has refused protection -

105
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,080
-And insist that we publish our terminal server.

106
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,040
Then they got ransomware, and boom the pay system stopped working. Nasty!

107
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,360
Ransomware is a billion dollar industry. It will only get bigger.

108
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,640
Swedish companies that are attacked by ransomware and pays ...

109
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,640
The total amount per year amounts to several billion SEK.

110
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,000
There are cases where Swedish companies has paid close to 300 million–

111
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,560
-To get their files unlocked. And that is ONE company.

112
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,760
A hacker who accessed resources can perform a ransomware attack.

113
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,680
What happens is that all files are encrypted and locked.

114
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,760
Now a key is required to restore everything.

115
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,080
The files were hijacked by the hacker, who demands money to unlock.

116
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,440
The Coop food chain had to close almost all of its 800 stores.

117
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,320
-After the cash register system failed.

118
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,640
This summer, Coop was hit by a ransomware attack-

119
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,680
-Which was also a supply chain attack.

120
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,320
Operation of Coop's cash register system is handled by the company Visma Esscom.

121
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,440
Visma in turn uses services from the company Kaseya.

122
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
It was Kaseya who was attacked by a hacker.

123
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,720
The malicious code was spread to Visma and caused Coop's cash registers to be locked.

124
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,600
Coop had to close 800 stores while they restarted all cash registers manually.

125
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,520
There are more examples of attacks which affected companies and infrastructure.

126
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,560
2019 the aluminium manufacturer Norsk Hydro was affected.

127
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,080
It was enough for an employee to click on a link in an email.

128
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,720
The hackers entered Hydro's IT environment and planted a virus–

129
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,480
-Which they used to encrypt information throughout the company.

130
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,280
Computers and servers were locked and production lines stopped.

131
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,240
The total sum for the attack estimated at $ 75 million.

132
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,520
Norsk Hydro never paid any ransom.

133
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,720
They had backups on their data and was able to restart operations.

134
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,600
Sensitive information about bank vaults, alarms systems and the government is online.

135
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,520
The security company Gunnebo was hit by a ransomware attack in 2020.

136
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,560
Gunnebo refused to pay the ransom. About 38,000 documents were leaked -

137
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,280
and are exposed online.

138
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,680
drawings of bank vaults, alarm systems and sensitive facilities.

139
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,680
In a survey among 150 IT-managers at Swedish companies -

140
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:44,040
- 30% state that they've been exposed to one ransomware attack in the last year.

141
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
Here we go. Let's do it.

142
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,200
-Now we're on our way. How nice! -It's fun to watch it.

143
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,920
Hey! I'm here to measure some moisture in your walls.

144
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,240
- From Sölvesborgs Construction, or? -Yes. Or from Sölvesborg municipality.

145
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,680
I checked under the sink and so on.

146
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,920
- Moist tile, then?. -Yeah, what the hell do I know?

147
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,360
In an attack like this, you don't know how prepared the victim is.

148
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,720
So you need to do it slowly and carefully, so that you do not ...

149
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,840
You don't want to make too much noise in the network.

150
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,480
You don't know what to expect. It's a bit like a maze without a map.

151
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:52,040
You have a bunch of cool tools, but there are monsters in the maze.

152
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,360
- No password spraying, just. -No no no.

153
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,040
Come on...! I Having some issues here.

154
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,920
We start to map out what is there. We clearly see people going home.

155
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,680
We have no success. The attacks which we normally use do not work.

156
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,680
I'm wondering if we should test–

157
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,960
-to do an active Responder on ONE computer.

158
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,280
-They have a lot of different things. - That's what I'm looking at.

159
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,480
I can't take it. I have to sleep.

160
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,560
We have a program which will run overnight–

161
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,880
-And when they come to the office tomorrow.

162
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,280
Hopefully someone has a laptop with them that they had brought home.

163
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,280
When they start it, it will hopefully trigger something that we can catch.

164
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,680
There is a reason to stay late.

165
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,240
You can do bolder things on the network -

166
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,400
- without worrying about people noticing it.

167
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,120
So there is every reason to stay late.

168
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,960
Ransomware attacks are common, but a crime that few want to talk about.

169
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,120
SVT has asked several companies subjected to major attacks -

170
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,680
- but none of them want to line up for an interview.

171
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,200
Nobody knows how common it is–

172
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,600
-Because companies do not report it to the police.

173
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,760
It may be that they think that the police will do nothing -

174
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,600
-Or that you do not want to broadcast that you have had an attack -

175
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,120
-Which has hit hard, because companies think it would mean-

176
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,000
-That "we show that we have bad security and get no customers ".

177
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,080
We have to be a bit more structured now.

178
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,160
- For Responder ... -Responder has no hits.

179
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,680
When we arrived today, nothing had happened.

180
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,280
We have to reach all these customers, that's the goal.

181
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,520
We need to access a machine, the backup server ...

182
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,160
We need to reach customers.

183
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,480
They may very well have some tech nerd who've made sure they are safe.

184
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,560
It's a disaster for us. Then we have to get very creative.

185
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,800
In the worst case you had a good idea there, Linus.

186
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:33,000
Trying to poison the network and force a machine to connect to us.

187
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,320
Maybe we should perform a bolder attack anyway.

188
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,720
With bolder I mean: If we're looking for something in a forest

189
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,840
- then we'll blow away all the trees to find something on the ground.

190
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,760
Jesper's attack will possibly stop the network from working -

191
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,720
-For the ones we attack.

192
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,280
Our tiny computer, which we have hidden behind a cupboard inside the company ...

193
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,440
We decided to tunnel all traffic through this little point–

194
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,680
-To force everything that is sitting in the network to do what we want.

195
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,560
Nobody remembers a coward. Shall we press all three?

196
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,800
-Shared responsibility is not responsibility. - You have full power.

197
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,080
I'll press now, then.

198
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,120
It's running.

199
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,640
Yes! New hash. Damn, what a treat.

200
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,720
Come on now!

201
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,520
It will be seen, this is noisy.

202
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,200
Yes, and it does.

203
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,880
–Oh, oh. - What?

204
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,680
- Have you found a net? Min session är nere.

205
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,080
-No no no....

206
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,600
They found it?

207
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,160
After a while our terminal freeze–

208
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,960
- and we lose the connection to our unit that sits on the inside.

209
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Yes, I'm all out.

210
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,560
- Damn. We were too aggressive. -Yes, you can probably say that.

211
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,520
They find our box and disconnect it. We lose the connection. Game over.

212
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,360
Now that we are blind again and have no access, we have a few hashes.

213
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,040
The hashes are the cryptographic equivalent of a password.

214
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,640
And we can crack these using computing power.

215
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:03,520
Powerful computers with graphics cards which we ask to solve our problem.

216
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,640
Time is running out. While Linus is trying to crack passwords

217
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,520
- Jinny and Jesper go back to the company office.

218
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,600
It's time to reveal ourselves.

219
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,560
We'll see what they answer, if they have noticed anything.

220
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,000
-Welcome! -Thank you. - After you.

221
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,640
-Are you having a good time? -Yes.

222
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,680
We have some friends with us, me and my colleague:

223
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,200
Jinny, or Frida.

224
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,160
We work as IT security experts.

225
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,240
We have been doing some stuff with you.

226
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,120
It's silence. Everything has been good? The week has been good?

227
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,760
No disturbances?

228
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,720
My feeling when these two people came in:

229
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,480
"Wow, now he's hired an entertainment group "-

230
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,960
- "which will entertain us." They said they were IT experts.

231
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,920
So I'm thinking: "Yes, now there will be a lot of IT jokes, because that's our thing. "

232
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,960
Anyone recognize my colleague here?

233
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,640
-Yes! No, what the hell ... - You should recognize me.

234
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,440
Oh, what the hell is that ...? Ah! Okay!

235
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,240
Then I recognize Jinny, who has infiltrated us.

236
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm the one who opens the door.

237
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,720
Hey! I'm here to measure some moisture in your walls.

238
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,800
-What did we do here, quite simply? -You were measuring moi ...

239
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,920
It was a very positive reaction. I was afraid he would get angry.

240
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,880
But he laughed and ... So there's shock, but laughter, as well.

241
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,960
I'm in a call when I open the door. I'm talking to a customer about security.

242
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,360
I say, "The doorbell rings."

243
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,240
"Hi, my name is Frida I'm going to measure moisture. "-" Yes, go ahead. "

244
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,120
"It's very important, with security! "

245
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,320
But you haven't noticed anything on infrastructure or ...?

246
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,040
We noticed a response on the computer, which did not feel natural.

247
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
What's supposed to happen doesn't happen–

248
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,640
- instead we get a  login box. That's weird.

249
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,600
We have seen a small box in a room which you may have put there.

250
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,280
I suspect that it's no longer connected.

251
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,080
-How did you find it? -A colleague of mine saw it.

252
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,680
In reality, one of our customers was attacked for real.

253
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,840
So Jörgen and I request  people to come here, and tell them:

254
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,320
"Now we have prio 1 alert. Someone has been hacked. "

255
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Pretty strange, weird timing.

256
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,560
They had another incident at the same time.

257
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,200
A customer had an intrusion while we were doing stuff.

258
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,120
"I see a box. Do you know anything about it?"

259
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,840
"No. No idea what internal project is this? "

260
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,440
"Then I want to disconnect it."

261
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,520
We could have stayed in the network longer if they did not have the incident.

262
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,440
So that was just unfortunate.

263
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,760
People have lost three years of work because they've been attacked.

264
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:08,320
They attacked the data, but also the backup of the data. Then it's gone.

265
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,040
Then you cry for real. You've worked for three years–

266
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,600
-for nothing and have to start over.

267
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,280
There is nothing to recreate or save.

268
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,480
We have taken two passwords and given them to our machines.

269
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,800
They're cracking the password still. It's not cracked yet.

270
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,200
We have had a very short time - we have spent almost two days on planning.

271
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,520
It's just a matter of time before this gets cracked.

272
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,600
We got our hands on two encrypted passwords - hashes.

273
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,840
We have tried to crack them for 24 hours and have not succeeded yet.

274
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,560
It's sad for us, but a good grade for Langate.

275
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,920
In my world you have succeeded, even if you don't think so.

276
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,320
The hackers managed to infiltrate the IT company–

277
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,080
-And had access to their network for over a day.

278
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,880
They could not get past the company's security system -

279
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,840
-And therefore could not access the customers in the network.

280
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,200
The passwords that the hackers came across kept good quality.

281
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,680
Attempts to crack them were discontinued after 48 hours.

282
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,200
They remain unresolved.

283
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,280
If I were an evil hacker, I'd be quieter–

284
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,800
- and take my time. When I had enough customers -

285
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,520
- I'd probably encrypt everything–

286
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,680
-And requested loads of money in ransom.

287
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,160
If they don't pay, yeah, go bankrupt, then.

288
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,840
"What do I care? I'm evil."

289
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,880
We currently don't have a basic level of security -

290
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,080
-So that we have a fairly high bar. The higher the bar is–

291
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,480
-The more costly and time consuming it is for an attacker-

292
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,480
- to try to access the information. This is business-critical.

293
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,000
This is what boards should be accustomed to dealing with.

294
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,000
You see investments in security as a cost.

295
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,480
If you see it as an investment, something that gives a return–

296
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:44,640
-it's easier to argue for. It's about the company's survival.

297
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,480
This has to end now. I'm tired of talking to desperate people -

298
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,400
-who get in trouble because of hacker attacks all the time.

299
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,320
Good morning, Klara. Hope you have slept well. Today it's sunny outside.

300
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,400
This so-called IoT man is like a damn mad scientist.

301
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,720
I'm safe, they're not getting in.

302
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,880
-Check if you get access. -It's up, we're in.
