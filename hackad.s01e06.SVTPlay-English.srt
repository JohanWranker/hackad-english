1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,680
Hey. Marcus.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,880
You have to register with both name and ID.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,000
You're not allowed to film anymore.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,240
For my part, it would be okay, but it must be approved by my boss.

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,880
We have reached the end of our experiment where four hackers–

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,400
- attacks people and companies to show how vulnerable we are.

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,040
We know that foreign powers have stolen information from Swedish authorities.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,720
In this episode the security will be tested at Telenor.

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,520
It's a critical infrastructure that foreign power wants control over.

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,760
There's a large flow of information.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,760
It will be the largest company we attack. A huge challenge.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,080
Can the hackers navigate past advanced security systems -

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,240
- and a large team that only exist to catch them?

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,720
This is one of our crisis rooms.

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,480
This is where we will have the exercise.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,720
-What computers will we get? -These are our client computers.

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,120
The hackers will act as agents from foreign power.

18
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,440
Telenor has advanced monitoring -

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,200
-And conduct regular simulated attacks to find weaknesses.

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,600
The hackers have received an office computer -

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,760
- which corresponds to the ones used by company employees.

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,760
They need to navigate as quietly as possible through the huge network -

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,840
-To find a path to servers with sensitive information.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,720
A major challenge with the assignment is that the company’s own security team

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,280
-Which is called Blue team, constantly scans the network for attackers.

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,000
That is what we have against us during these hours.

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,720
The idea is that security should be as normal as possible.

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,120
My primary responsibility is to ensure that the technology works.

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,160
Also make sure that they don't break anything.

30
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,480
Whatever we poke at there are sensors there?

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,760
Yes.

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,640
It's not easy.

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,160
It will be a challenge.

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,320
It will be difficult, I think so.

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,040
We have many limitations and little time.

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,640
We have two days, maybe 30 hours if we don't sleep.

37
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Very bad conditions for us to succeed.

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,120
There has been a lot of preparation, many meetings–

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,840
-Where we've discussed both the exercise and all legislation.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,480
We have signed agreements, at least two.

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,960
There are so many rules.

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,520
If they don't follow them, we'll kick them out.

43
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,880
All offensive decisions we must take together.

44
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,360
They have to go through the exercise leaders.

45
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,720
To sit there on a system that is incredibly large–

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,640
- with many limitations, computers that are not even your own

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,200
- and a process that makes you have to get everything approved by a dungeon master ...

48
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Do you feel ready, and have everything you need?

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,480
-I think so. -Perfect, then we'll start the exercise.

50
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,520
Let's take these off.

51
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,600
So should I look at storage space on the network?

52
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,520
Including databases.

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,760
- You'll go for accounts. -Everything with AD, at a slow pace.

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,600
–Webb. -Everything like that.

55
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,080
To avoid making noise -

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
it'll be good if we can look for things which can give us more.

57
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,520
Now we need to figure out how the network looks like-

58
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,480
- without showing the Blue team that we're here–

59
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,040
And find the networks that aren't forbidden, and attack them.

60
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,040
Tele companies are equally important as bridges, roads, harbors.

61
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,160
An attack on a large tele company can seriously disrupt–

62
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,400
society's ability to function.

63
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Customer information, calls ... Everything - text messages and stuff.

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,360
All that information is very sensitive -

65
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,600
-And is fantastic for us as a foreign power to access.

66
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:32,480
Just that people use SMS to log in to accounts ...

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,480
If we can then take over arbitrary phone numbers, we can access

68
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,000
-Many people's accounts.

69
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,920
We've got these hackers here, who are among the better in Sweden.

70
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,080
How do they think? What tactics and what tools do they use?

71
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,680
And how do they do it? It's most interesting.

72
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,920
They don't know that our plan is to suck out their knowledge.

73
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,160
Ulf Andersson works as information security manager–

74
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,640
-But has its background in the intelligence service and Säpo.

75
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,400
He brings with him his experiences into the job of IT security.

76
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,440
In my team we have hackers–

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,480
-But if you add intelligence- background, to really understand

78
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,560
- what intelligence is all about, how you work to get information ...

79
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,520
To translate it into this field, I think gives a great advantage.

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,080
Because everything is about obtaining information.

81
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,600
The one who has most information will win, history has proven.

82
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,600
Stig Wennerström, one of Sweden's most famous spies–

83
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,280
- is arrested and brought to justice in 1963, after 20 years of reconnaissance work.

84
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,280
In his home there's photographic equipment and microfilms with documents

85
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,800
- which Wennerström photographed and sent to the Soviet Union.

86
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,040
But today the spies are sitting in front of the computer.

87
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,200
The cyber attacks from foreign powers are so frequent and intense–

88
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,240
- that they are on the border between espionage and low-intensity warfare.

89
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,160
The US president warned this spring for the consequences of the development.

90
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,040
The threat to Sweden in the form of cyber attacks from foreign powers

91
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
- are real.

92
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,400
We see how the threats have expanded and deepened over a number of years.

93
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,000
The consequences are serious. It's for real - they're real people.

94
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,600
It takes place daily against Sweden from a variety of countries.

95
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,400
We see how foreign power comes in and steals research, development -

96
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,760
-blueprints - entire production environments, to bring home to their countries.

97
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:36,000
The countries that pose the greatest threat are Russia, China and Iran.

98
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,000
Today it's an uneven match. Those who attack us have a head start.

99
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,360
Not much resources are invested in security, which would be needed

100
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,960
- considering the threat. There are great values at stake.

101
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,640
It's not just computer stuff, the consequences can be serious.

102
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,400
They can affect the financial foundations of Sweden's democracy.

103
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,840
-How's it going? - The technology is up and running.

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,880
So they will probably have a lot to do. Absolutely.

105
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,600
I talked to the Blue team, they got the starting signal at the same time.

106
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
Okay.

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,040
Then they'll soon be discovered.

108
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,040
Yes. We'll see, it hasn't been that long.

109
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
10 62.

110
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,280
Is it also forbidden? Everything is forbidden.

111
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
We had a list of systems which we weren't allowed to touch.

112
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,600
On that list, they added more and more.

113
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,680
The more we found, the more they realized: "No, by the way, don't touch it."

114
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
We suggested several attacks.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,920
Each attack must be approved, so we had to wait a lot.

116
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
It's so frustrating!

117
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,120
Our core network has all the info.

118
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,200
This is where our secret databases are located, with all customer data.

119
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,680
That's where you want to go when talking telecommunications.

120
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,520
They were not allowed to go there. We had  limits on what they were allowed to do.

121
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,600
We knew that if they go there-

122
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,800
- functions could break down, and we would have a lot of problems.

123
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,000
It became messy. Everyone tried to be creative and come up with good ideas.

124
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
This is half joke, half serious. Let's buy a botnet.

125
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Nuke some service from the outside... No, but listen. Hear me out!

126
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,080
Basically three kids in a candy store.

127
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,160
Normally when we do this, it's "free for all", just to pick and attack.

128
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,960
You lost me when you said: "Buy a botnet."

129
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,680
In the end, we ignored the alarms and just rolled with it.

130
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,600
"We're getting nowhere," because everything was forbidden. We did everything we could.

131
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,760
To navigate the huge network they need to do a scan -

132
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,640
-On over 4,000 IP addresses.

133
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,880
The problem is that it generates a lot of traffic. They risk detection.

134
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,600
We'll ignore the Blue team. We're hoping they look at China.

135
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,200
If they don't detect us now, they're real losers. We'll assume they will.

136
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,720
Three ... two ... one ...

137
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,880
Blue team - now they'll stop drinking coffee.

138
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,120
There was a lot of traffic which was pushed through. Very obvious.

139
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,040
All their logs lit up like a Christmas tree, probably.

140
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,880
-Hello. -Hey.

141
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,600
-How's it going? -To hell.

142
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,720
A cat and rat game. You should never accept that a foreign power is inside.

143
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,480
No other technical problems which we need to sort out?

144
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,720
No.

145
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,920
I have contact with the Blue team internally.

146
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,520
They get no info what is happening on the other side. I'll look up what they find.

147
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,920
Yes.... Yes?

148
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,240
I checked with the Blue team. It was actually very comical ...

149
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,640
They said it sounded like a tank drove around the infrastructure.

150
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,840
They are THAT noisy?

151
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,280
In a realistic scenario, we would have stopped them immediately.

152
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,440
After a few minutes or so.

153
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,640
But then there wont be an exercise. What do you learn from stopping it?

154
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,400
It's better to open the door and see what they'll do.

155
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,800
Give me five minutes.

156
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,440
-Should I run a hydra from our C2? -Yes. Take one at a time.

157
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,240
Check.

158
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,400
We asked Marcus: "May we look at other parts of the network? "

159
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,720
We got to look at some other systems.

160
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,400
On them, Jinny found an encrypted password.

161
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,760
Actually, we found 26 encrypted passwords.

162
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,200
But one of them we managed to crack with a simple dictionary.

163
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,560
We have found a machine which we can access.

164
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,800
It had a folder that we can read.

165
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:27,440
Tt looks like there are folders which appears to belong to users.

166
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:35,240
Maybe all users, even. We can read them and watch the content.

167
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,880
If an administrator has saved their password in their profile.

168
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,480
Then we have it and maybe can jump to other machines.

169
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,760
Take over machines, quite simply. Jump on to the more sensitive resources.

170
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,120
What Linus is doing now is to copy over all content–

171
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,880
-To a USB stick, so that we get access to all that information.

172
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Even if the Blue team sees this ...

173
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,280
We don't care. We just want to get the info as fast as possible.

174
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,960
We'll barricade that door, so that they can't break in.

175
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,400
That's what we're doing right now. It's the first really interesting finding.

176
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,280
It could be a gold mine.

177
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,360
I think... There has been a shift.

178
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,960
Private companies, especially the telco companies -

179
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,320
-Have realized that they are socially critical infrastructure.

180
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,200
They are the key for society to work. Everything is based on communication.

181
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,760
That awakening has probably happened since x number of years back.

182
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,440
If the communication stops working, society is likely to collapse.

183
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,960
Then we can't communicate. We are so used to the phone constantly working.

184
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,760
That's the big awakening among telecom companies.

185
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,040
To realize that we are so important to society.

186
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,480
Many cyber attacks have been linked to foreign power.

187
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,360
This applies to attacks on waterworks, food manufacturers -

188
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,600
-Fuel companies and authorities.

189
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,760
The US administration accuses Russia

190
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,920
-To allow hacker groups to act freely, without intervening.

191
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,880
Biden has proposed an agreement which protects critical infrastructure.

192
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,480
We are used to battles between countries being conducted militarily.

193
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,440
But thanks to technological development and development of cyber tools -

194
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,320
- much of the struggle has been moved to the cyber domains or the cyber world.

195
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,520
That's where it takes place a struggle between countries.

196
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,280
It's not as visible.

197
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,400
You may not always know who fires the digital shots.

198
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:46,280
Which makes the security environment has become more difficult to understand.

199
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,200
You have to take security seriously.

200
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:56,440
One must take the ability of a foreign power to conduct such business seriously.

201
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,720
These are people in other countries who have a salary–

202
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,520
-To conduct that type of activities - government officials.

203
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,400
There are companies that have been unaware that they have had an IT intrusion.

204
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,880
They have become aware of it only when we contacted them–

205
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,160
-Or when they see a copy of their product in another country.

206
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,840
That's because those countries have big resources and are technically proficient.

207
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,760
If they meet a Swedish company who do not have a high level of protection

208
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,400
- it will be an easy prey.

209
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,880
IT security will become even more important.

210
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,560
In the future, we will be more connected.

211
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,520
Launch of 5G, which is coming, means that we become even more connected.

212
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,480
The cars will be connected.

213
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,240
Everything from refrigerators to whatever you can imagine, will be connected.

214
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,000
There will always be vulnerabilities, so people need to be more prepared–

215
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,720
-And test themselves.

216
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,000
It is about who finds the vulnerabilities first, we or the opponent?

217
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,320
Then it's better to try to find the vulnerabilities yourself.

218
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,040
Get help from anyone who can help.

219
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Continue to find your own vulnerabilities.

220
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,760
I have found a lot of systems that are super interesting - old stuff.

221
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,520
We can always get in there.

222
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Blue team seems to have seen that you made weird connections to the Internet.

223
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,520
That they want an explanation for.

224
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,200
- Against the internet? -Yes, some port 22.

225
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,800
It was against your address.

226
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,440
We're downloading a "wordlist" to crack hashes.

227
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,680
Yes.

228
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:06,680
- Did you talk to a colleague? - We haven't spoken to anyone on the phone.

229
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,640
-So you got no help? No.

230
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,400
We found quite a lot of interesting stuff.

231
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,800
27 minutes left, and we've cracked a hash.

232
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,360
We have a hash. We have that password.

233
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
That was interesting. Really good.

234
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,200
Yes, Jinny is testing if she can login with it.

235
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:43,360
I feel that Marcus became quite nervous when he saw the account.

236
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,480
We asked for a "ticket". Then we cracked it.

237
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,680
But how did you find the service?

238
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,160
- We asked ... -You ran that ... what's it called?

239
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,000
Get-SPN. We've found a lot of fun. stuff.

240
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,120
We are now decrypting this.

241
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,080
These are saved passwords in a Chrome session.

242
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,360
We've got a lot of Chrome files from these profiles.

243
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,280
In the vhd files, someone has saved passwords in the browser.

244
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,720
Username "Admin", to all of these addresses.

245
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,200
We don't have the password yet, but looking at it.

246
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,640
We've also gotten in here.

247
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,400
It's a Wiki ... Maybe shouldn't film it before he says okay.

248
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,640
I created an account. I was allowed to create an account -

249
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,160
-And I've read a lot of interesting stuff.

250
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,000
-It's interesting. -Yes it is.

251
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,920
The wiki server contained information -

252
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,280
-Which can be seen as a kind of map over parts of the network.

253
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,760
We haven't had time to analyze the material.

254
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,440
It seems to be username and passwords to other parts of the network -

255
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,080
- which isn't good at all. That is the risk we must address.

256
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,360
We found an account ... You seem to want to do something.

257
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:22,040
Now we have a hash we have to crack. If it works, we can decrypt them ...

258
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,560
- Where did you get that hash from? -Magic.

259
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,440
I searched for the password, and then I read. Do you have to kill me now?

260
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,160
Yes.

261
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,480
No, so ... Is the camera off?

262
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,680
-What has happened now? - They have discovered ...

263
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,040
... that they could retrieve passwords from internal services.

264
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,240
-Food! - Wonderful!

265
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,920
The next directive is that as soon as the Blue team thinks that this-

266
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,680
-Can risk our services, then we cancel.

267
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:19,560
We went from practice mode to incident mode where all teams are activated.

268
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,880
You may notify the hackers to stop.

269
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,080
Hi. Could you pause everything and come with me?

270
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,200
We'll have an incident meeting. It's important that we do it now.

271
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,520
-Come, we need to fix this. -You look so serious.

272
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Can we turn off the camera and tell us what we aren't allowed to do?

273
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,600
It is "no go zone".

274
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,360
Shall we gather?

275
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,480
Good. - Thank you, Marcus.

276
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,000
We had to take a short break and stop the exercise a bit.

277
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,640
You were supposed to find things.

278
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,320
That's why we joined this game. And now you have done it.

279
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,360
It's really fantastic. But what you have found, must be fixed.

280
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,680
And it's pretty urgent. We have started the incident process.

281
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,800
Because what you found ... I can't say where you would have ended up–

282
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
-But we value it as a major vulnerability.

283
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,600
So I find it difficult to continue the exercise.

284
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,600
But at the same time I'm incredibly grateful –

285
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,280
- that you have found it.

286
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,640
Somehow I'm glad that we could do this together.

287
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,760
I'm trying to convey a joy here.

288
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,040
But also a concern, because we have to fix it.

289
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,240
If a real opponent found it, it would have major consequences.

290
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,760
Shall we continue the exercise or fix the vulnerability?

291
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:21,600
The choice was pretty easy for me. I quickly realized:

292
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,720
"Now it's serious, now we can't discuss viewer numbers. "

293
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,320
Thanks! Totally fantastic that you found the vulnerability.

294
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,960
A bit frustrating. I guess this is how to end an exercise-

295
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:45,280
-When you find something really juicy, which makes us even better.

296
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,960
So super-thank you.

297
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,280
The hackers were discovered early and did not reach the sensitive servers.

298
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,840
However, they found vulnerabilities that got Telenor to cancel the exercise -

299
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,800
-To initiate incident management.

300
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,920
It turned out that the information didn't lead to critical data.

301
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,880
The risk is still greater if you don't do this.

302
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:20,280
"If we don't do this, we'll still get greater risks, because then we know nothing. "

303
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,000
Knowing nothing is the biggest risk.

304
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,000
We live in a digital society–

305
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,640
- where our assets online are as real as the physical ones.

306
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:43,360
The hackers have shown how easy it is to gain access to individuals and companies.

307
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,520
It's time to take your digital life seriously.

308
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:54,440
I think we will be able to handle information like we've always done.

309
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,080
It takes time, and things will happen.

310
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,880
But they had the same discussion about the telegraph - it was dangerous.

311
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,040
The radio was dangerous. We're not even going to talk about TV.

312
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,880
I see a bright future.

313
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,720
In 20-30 years, I think we'll have adapted to digitalisation.

314
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,360
To be afraid of such activities is not something you gain on.

315
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,800
We advocate sound vigilance.

316
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,280
To have the radar up and keep track of your surroundings.

317
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,600
This competence must be taught as early as possible - in preschool -

318
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,600
-In primary school, in high school and also in higher education.

319
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,520
Because this is important to learn.

320
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,960
