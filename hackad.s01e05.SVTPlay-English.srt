1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,440
The time now is 09.08. - Anders!

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,760
The time now is 09.08, I'm now putting on the first product.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,640
Linus found her downtown and pretended to be a fan of some sort–

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,880
- and wanted a selfie.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,240
Excuse me. Therese Lindgren? My daughter watches you on Youtube.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,920
- Can I take a selfie? -Of course.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,920
People tend to lower their guard a bit when it comes to children.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,440
It's a nasty tactic, but that's how it is online. There are no rules there.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,720
What does the CEO say about how to protect yourself online?

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,880
You have a password and double password.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,360
-He should have had triple passwords! -Hope he has.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,160
And do you know what their password was?

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm not joking. They had Password01.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,880
I love "Svenska Nyheter", so it was fun to hit back.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,800
SVT is letting professionals  hack individuals and companies -

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,200
-To show the vulnerabilities in our society.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,400
David, Linus, Jesper and Jinny got 48 hours to hack–

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,880
- two public figures: The influencer Therese Lindgren–

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,280
And the host Kristoffer Appelquist.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,400
To infiltrate and hijack their largest and most important online accounts.

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,120
Password01 ... I wonder if the experts believe–

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,240
- that there really is criminal superminds behind this.

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,640
But the government need help with keeping IT security at a reasonable level.

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
We've been looking at his online footprint.

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,840
We've looked in leaked databases and found some passwords.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,080
Probably old passwords to old accounts that leaked.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,240
We checked his sites online.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,600
Often people are already hacked without knowing about it.

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,240
There are loads of information for sale on the Internet.

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,800
For instance, your address or password to your email is for sale.

31
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,080
They are incredibly cheap to buy, so you can buy millions of them.

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,960
Then if I choose you, I can try the password–

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,520
- since many people reuse the same password in several places.

34
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,720
It's mainly two passwords he's very in love with.

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,280
- He's not a mastermind of passwords? -No.

36
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,320
"Katamaran" has been used more than once. Then the best password–

37
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,520
-Which makes you like him: "hatasj". He's probably commuted a lot.

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,800
It's quite frustrating, because we have tested the passwords we found.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:05,120
Nothing works. Linus and I have coded a cool thing.

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,520
But it requires access to the computer.

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,120
We must somehow deliver some form of code, a back door.

42
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,800
We need access to a device on his computer.

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,080
It should work. We wont fail.

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,440
Lots of people here now. We NEED to get access to his laptop.

45
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,640
We can't do it from the outside in the time we have.

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,640
-Yes ... It's cheating, but ... -Yeah, but you ask us to do magic.

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,880
We get so little time to do something that takes a hell of a long time.

48
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,760
When you're fishing for peoples password-

49
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,000
-you send 10 000 emails. Eventually someone takes the bait.

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,440
Here you ask us to go in and just ... / FINGER SNAP /

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,800
-It's not possible. -If we get him away from the computer ...

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,840
It's a classic thing that people do, they leave their computer unlocked.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,760
Kristoffer has approved to be hacked.

54
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,080
The only thing he knows is that it will take place in the next few weeks–

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,440
- and that he will be interviewed by SVT.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,640
I'll join you. I'll borrow a camera. I don't know how it works, but ...

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,520
I'm from Gothenburg, It'll be fine. The only cheat we're asking for ...

58
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,760
... is access to the computer for a minute.

59
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,080
You get to join us, and if you can do stuff with his computer you get to do it.

60
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,040
I'm reading comments. I'm looking for...

61
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,440
... language and words I can use in a phishing email.

62
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,280
Phishing is when you email and claim to be someone–

63
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:21,160
-And then tries to trick the recipient run a file or click on a link -

64
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,680
-Where they may need to log in with a password or similar.

65
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
Our new identity is Frida Kvarnesson.

66
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,200
I don't even know if it's a real name, now it is anyway.

67
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,920
We have all this material to create this character -

68
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,520
-and hopefully get Therese into a false sense of security -

69
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,720
- that it's a child and not someone who can hurt her.

70
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,920
We hope it increases the chance that she gives us her login information.

71
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,920
It's uncomfortable for me to log in with my index finger. Just a thing like that.

72
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,600
I started a makeup channel on Youtube, but only after a year–

73
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,760
- I started to mention that I was suffering from panic disorder.

74
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,080
Then I got a lot of questions about mental illness and personal issues.

75
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,440
I then changed my content a bit to what the people watching my videos–

76
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,760
- were interested in. It suited me much better too.

77
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,960
Today it's a lifestyle channel. I record my days.

78
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,640
Today there's one million followers both on Youtube and Instagram.

79
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm really a control freak, so it feels uncomfortable that I'm ...

80
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,600
... not really in control over the technical.

81
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,280
Should my Youtube channel vanish because someone hacks it-

82
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,520
-Or whatever can happen online, then I don't know what I'll do.

83
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,640
I don't have a number for Youtube that can solve it. It's scary.

84
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm very vulnerable. Every day I get SMS from Snapchat, Instagram ...

85
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,840
... and Facebook, which says: "This is the code to enter."

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,640
A two-step verification. So many people trying to get into my accounts.

87
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,000
But so far I have never been hacked.

88
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
"Hey, Tessan!"

89
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,160
"My dad met you downtown."

90
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,680
We can "slam" a heart emoji here.

91
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,200
Hopefully she'll click on the link -

92
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,040
And comes to a login page for her Youtube account -

93
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,240
- that we have created - a fake page. She's asked to log in to Youtube.

94
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,480
Hopefully she doesn't think twice and enters her information.

95
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,720
Then we'll have it and can log in to her Youtube.

96
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,480
I think I'm pretty reserved. It'll probably backfire.

97
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,040
But I don't save my passwords so that they are auto-filled.

98
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,960
When I enter credit card numbers -

99
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,200
-It asks if I want to save it, but I always press no.

100
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,480
I usually turn off location services on apps.

101
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,120
I still think about it a bit, compared to my partner who just pushes yes.

102
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,640
Phishing is behind 50-70% of all data breaches. That's the key to

103
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,200
- the most complex crimes we have in the world. It's the email itself ...

104
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,320
According to Statistics Sweden, it was sent to three million Swedes some years ago–

105
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,680
–These types of emails. And I know there are even more.

106
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,640
So it's the crime where you use the power of the internet the most.

107
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,880
It's a simple way to trick a large number of people.

108
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,720
It's enough that a few people falls for it for the people behind to earn-

109
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,480
- an incredible amount. There's a huge amount of money in it.

110
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,840
The plan is to try to infect Kristoffer's laptop with a back door.

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
A hidden program that gives us remote access to it-

112
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,840
-so we can spy on the user.

113
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,040
But many variables and obstacles make it difficult, and time is short.

114
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,240
To avoid suspicion Jesper pretends he's a photographer.

115
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,040
The goal is to run malicious code on Kristoffer's computer via a USB

116
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,240
- without him noticing.

117
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,240
-Hey! Welcome. -Thanks. I'm Jesper.

118
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,880
I got a camera and pretended like I belonged.

119
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,600
I walked around the room and pretended that I was one of the team.

120
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,240
At the same time I had contact with my colleagues on the outside.

121
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Everyone in Ocean's Thirteen who intends to rob a bank

122
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,000
-But haven't managed to get the blueprints yet, can relax.

123
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,800
Such blueprints have leaked! Who are these hackers?

124
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,080
They are ingenious. We have to work even harder to catch up.

125
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,520
I am a TV host at SVT and host Svenska Nyheter.

126
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,680
I work full time with it 20 weeks a year.

127
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,400
Otherwise, I do podcasts which we record and edit here.

128
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,080
Let's prepare the interview. We'll take a picture when Jesper sits down.

129
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,920
I'll take one in here when it's empty.

130
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,920
When you left and did the interview I was alone in one of the rooms.

131
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,240
There was no door in between. I could have poked him in the neck.

132
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,720
Very close! Not much sound is needed for someone to turn around.

133
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,960
While the team prepares the interview -

134
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,200
- David and Linus drives to Therese's apartment to plant more traps.

135
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,240
- Do you have her address? -No, I actually don't have that.

136
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
- Should I fix it? -Yes, do it.

137
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,600
Therese: The worst that can happen is everything that risk my safety.

138
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,920
It only takes one crazy person -

139
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,200
- to make it very uncomfortable for me and my family.

140
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,960
The worst that can happen is private information being spread-

141
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,480
-like phone number and address, and that the wrong person uses it against me.

142
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,520
David is preparing an envelope with her address on–

143
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,080
And a letter with a USB stick, a usb memory.

144
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,960
There's a backdoor on it. It looks like a pdf file but is a backdoor.

145
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,240
We'll drop it in her mailbox.

146
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,400
We trick her to open the file.

147
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,080
We'll say we nominate her for an award–

148
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,200
-Because she's a good influencer and has made a effort.

149
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,880
I'll see if I can attack her wifi.

150
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,400
It could work or completely fail, but here we go.

151
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,600
David and I were waiting outside her gate for someone to enter.

152
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,000
Then the plan was to follow. Two people came -

153
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,240
-Which entered the adjoining gate so then we went in there instead.

154
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,520
It turned out that we got into her staircase via that gate as well.

155
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,280
I have the PIN code for the door, if we want to come back.

156
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,480
The USB stick is delivered. If she pluggs it into the laptop and opens the file-

157
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,720
- then we'll get access to her computer and can steal secrets–

158
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,960
-And maybe access password.

159
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,720
We have recorded signals from the wifi.

160
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,920
If we break the wifi password, we go back.

161
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,920
We're trying as many attack surfaces as possible–

162
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,240
- instead of all the eggs in one basket.

163
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,640
The risk is that it doesn't work. She may not even read the email.

164
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,840
Someone else might handle her emails. A lot can go wrong.

165
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,720
That's why we're throwing a wide net, to increase the chance of success.

166
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,680
We agree that that you should challenge your mandate.

167
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,240
Interesting things happen there, whether you are a host -

168
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,560
-Or if you are the principal of a school.

169
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,120
Challenge what you are allowed to do and consider what you'd rather do–

170
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,320
-And try to squeeze it into your mandate.

171
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,760
It will be much more fun if you do.

172
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,560
What happens will happen. The USB will place files locally-

173
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,680
-But also sends two connections to our server.

174
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,440
Älvsjö. It's running.

175
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,040
-Maybe it's the USB. Yes, yes, yes!

176
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,560
I suspect that my approach to IT security–

177
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,840
- is a bit like people's attitude to safety at sea.

178
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,480
"I don't need a life jacket, because I never go near the edge. "

179
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,680
You're thinking one step too short. If there's a fire, you have to jump overboard.

180
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,880
Then the difference between survival and death is a life jacket.

181
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,400
You don't understand what you're doing But I don't think I'm the worst.

182
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,640
I've still made an effort at some point. I don't want to be the guy who didn't want-

183
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,320
- there to be cars, because horses were safer.

184
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,680
This is how it is.

185
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,920
There is nothing worse than sitting in an internal system -

186
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,560
- like an uncle named Leif has created, which sucks-

187
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,480
-Just to avoid sharing our eating habits -

188
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,720
- with Silicon Valley. Which they will find somewhere anyway.

189
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,960
I can 't do anything about it. Deal with it.

190
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,040
- Is it still open? -Yes.

191
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,240
-Now! -Yes! We're in!

192
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,560
We have access to basically all files, and we're downloading them.

193
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,760
Documents, photos, but above all passwords.

194
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:29,640
We downloaded everything that may contain passwords, such as browsers.

195
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,560
-Thanks so much. See you tonight. -Yes, we will.

196
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,600
Even if the hackers have access to Kristoffer's computer -

197
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,160
- they need to get the passwords. This is where key chain comes into the picture.

198
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,640
Key chain is an encrypted container where the computer saves passwords

199
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,960
PIN codes and credit card details. For our hackers, it's a goldmine.

200
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,280
The problem is that the lock is robust and hard to crack.

201
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,880
You are currently 1:st in the queue.

202
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,800
People often use the same basis when picking passwords.

203
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,040
It's super common for people to add a year and a special character.

204
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,360
So that he has one of his former known passwords with a year after–

205
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,560
- is something we must try.

206
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,200
Welcome to the Tax Information.

207
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,800
Hi. My name is Linus. I want some information about a person's child.

208
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,960
We'll see what information we have.

209
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,640
It's easy to call the Swedish Tax Agency, it's like an open book.

210
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,920
- Is this about Kristoffer Appelquist? -Yes.

211
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,280
Two adult children and a minor. Want to know who the adults are?

212
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,600
Everyone.

213
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,240
- Was it the addresses you wanted? –Social security numbers.

214
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,360
Something we know is common is to use the children's birthyear.

215
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,200
-Only the first six digits? - No, all of it.

216
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,160
-Great. Thanks so much. -Thanks. Bye.

217
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,280
This is not Denmark, with semi-secret social security numbers.

218
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,480
We guessed passwords like crazy. Pretty slow against an Apple Keychain.

219
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,160
It went slowly. The hours went. We had a deadline of 20:00.

220
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,120
I'm gonna have to stop now. I just don't have enough time.

221
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,680
- Therese? -Yes. It will be difficult.

222
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,840
We've tried to crack her wifi, but failed.

223
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,320
We put a letter with a usb memory in her mailbox.

224
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:00,200
She hasn't plugged it in it seems. We still have the phishing attack.

225
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,560
I can imagine Therese's day starts with her having her morning coffee.

226
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,800
Then she opens her computer, and there's 56,000 unread emails.

227
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,200
Scroll, scroll. "Let's get to work." I don't think she has time.

228
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,680
Since yesterday I have received text messages which looks different.

229
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,200
It's an sms with asian characters, I don't know what language. And...

230
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,440
And yesterday when I sat on Youtube, I was logged out.

231
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,000
My partner asked: "Does this usually happen?" It has not happened in eight years -

232
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,480
-That I was suddenly logged out of Google and Youtube.

233
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,720
So that was weird.

234
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,880
The hackers realize that there's no time to both steal Therese's password-

235
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,160
–And get past her two-factor- authentication. The hack is canceled.

236
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,440
-Hello. -Hello! Hey!

237
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,400
-How's it going? -Good.

238
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,040
You have on the street met a dad to a fan.

239
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,440
-Yes!.

240
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I was so happy too.

241
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,480
And then I got an email from his daughter and became so happy.

242
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,160
I clicked the link, because she had seen something in a video. I clicked.

243
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,840
What happened then?

244
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,640
It came up that I should fill in my details. So I closed it.

245
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,560
–Ah ... - We sent you phishing emails.

246
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,200
The goal was to get you to click -

247
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,720
-And hopefully, sometime when you're not so alert, log in–

248
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,960
-And then we hope that the details were used elsewhere.

249
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,440
Oh, no! Was it phishing, phishing- email, when you send out links?

250
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,640
-Exactly. "Nätfiske" in Swedish. -I understand.

251
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,520
Very well done, Therese!

252
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,640
This was very unpleasant, but it was very interesting.

253
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,040
I have learned a lot about reflecting.

254
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,320
- Very kind of you, Therese. -Thank you so much for today.

255
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,520
We all need to improve our security on the internet, talk about it.

256
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,720
We need to educate ourselves and each other.

257
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,920
We need to make demands on politicians for major efforts -

258
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,160
- when it comes to our IT security.

259
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,440
They need to give more money to the police–

260
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,160
So that they can investigate and prevent crime on the internet.

261
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,360
These are important issues.

262
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,160
Passwords must be unique. That is the most important thing.

263
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Because if one service gets hacked, you only need to change that password-

264
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,720
- and wont risk something happening on the other sites.

265
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,040
The second is that it must be long - at least 12-15 characters.

266
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,240
The children's names - no. The dog's name or the registration number - no.

267
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,200
123456 - no, come on!

268
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,520
Rather than a character soup you can use a phrase. You can have:

269
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,840
"MyMotherSangForMeOnce- WhenIWasSleeping".

270
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,480
The longer, the harder it is to crack. It is easier to remember phrases.

271
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,640
But we shouldn't have to remember passwords - use password manager!

272
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,080
There are countless of them. find out your needs, and choose tools.

273
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,920
–Hey! Good work! -So damn nice!

274
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,640
The breakthrough came when my computer cracked the password to his key chain.

275
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,000
It was a combination of his old password "hatasj" -

276
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:15,120
And the birth year of one of his children. Then the treasure chest opened: key chain.

277
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Now we all have passwords in the key chain. We have Chrome login passwords.

278
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,520
We have to decrypt it now, because it contains more passwords.

279
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:33,760
David managed to decrypt it and the secrets just poured out.

280
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,440
We all have passwords for Chrome Extensions now. Everything!

281
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,080
–The works! –162 different ones. Good.

282
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,200
-We can login to Instagram, right? -What nasty tricks should we do?

283
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,520
-I think a picture is fun. - I can check Facebook.

284
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
He has to put up with a bit of mischief.

285
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,520
We take a picture where we stand with a sign: "Double passwords."

286
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,440
Are you ready? Smile.

287
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Ten hours has passed since the hackers infected Kristoffer's computer.

288
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,120
Now Jesper can be himself. It's time to reveal himself.

289
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,840
-Hello! My name is Jesper. -Welcome.

290
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,600
I work as an IT security specialist - you probably already understood that.

291
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,920
-I have. - You look a bit confused.

292
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,120
No, but ... I think we have had contact during the day.

293
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,160
- I got some emails because of you. -That's probably true.

294
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,640
-At least the last few hours. -Right.

295
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,480
- Have you noticed anything else? -I think Instagram, Facebook and ...

296
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,920
- Can we check Instagram now, or? -Yes absolutely.

297
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,840
Damn, you didn't post on Instagram? -No no no....

298
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,040
Check the latest post. Are you nervous, or?

299
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,480
-Yes of course. No worries, it's safe for work.

300
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,160
Do you recognize anyone? / JESPER LAUGHS /

301
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,840
Thank you very much. It says "double passwords".

302
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,200
Proof that I was owned, It hurt little.

303
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,760
I'm not an IT manager at some damn security company.

304
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,280
-I'm a clown. -But a pretty good clown.

305
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,480
But I didn't do this alone, I had help. Here they are.

306
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,880
Can you see us? You're frozen.

307
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,480
-Yes now. Hey! -Hello!

308
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,640
David and I were in the hotel room and joined via Teams.

309
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,720
We could control his computer from there.

310
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,440
- Do you have your computer in front of you? -I do.

311
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,920
Is there something on your screen now?

312
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,600
I opened this document that I had-

313
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,760
- with over 100 usernames and password, on the screen.

314
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,320
–Shit! - You need triple passwords.

315
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,160
Thanks. I knew this would come back and bite me in the ass.

316
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,400
It was fun hacking Kristoffer, since Svenska Nyheter is quite provocative.

317
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
He took it well.

318
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,720
But ... oh yeah. It's pretty frustrating, because it's not just my passwords.

319
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,040
It's SVT's password -

320
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,240
-Which I have been given as trade secrets. Damn, this sucks!

321
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,480
But you know? I'm also super happy.

322
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,680
Because if I had this list, I would have save so much time!

323
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,320
I've agreed to this, so not much to whine about.

324
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,560
It's an eye opener how all your stuff is connected.

325
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,880
"I have that password there too, so if someone finds it "...

326
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,160
I get that someone malicious can mess things up for me.

327
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,920
A bit like standing at the board in The Luxury Trap:

328
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,280
"I knew I had bad economy but not that it was this bad. "

329
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Good summary.

330
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,200
The hackers' phishing against Therese failed.

331
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,720
Therese clicked on a link, but never entered her details.

332
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,920
Kristoffer's computer was infected.

333
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,240
The hackers could, after eight hours unlock the computer key chain.

334
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,200
They stole just over 100 credentials, like Kristoffer's Instagram account.

335
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,840
Kristoffer: I was happy to join this program.

336
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,040
The reason is simple: It would be fun to find out what I am worst at–

337
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,360
-So that I can be the best at it instead. Now I can start doing it right.

338
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,760
I searched for passwords. Then I've been reading. You have to kill me now?

339
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,640
-No, but ... Is the camera turned off? - We need to fix this.

340
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,880
What you have found, we have to fix - and it's pretty urgent.

341
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,120
