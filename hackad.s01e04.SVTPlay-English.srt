1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,920
/ ALARM /

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Good morning, Klara. Hope you have slept well.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,680
It is sunny outside. The temperature is 7 degrees and it's quite windy.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,280
Good morning, Molly. Hope you have slept well.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,560
It's Tuesday. Don't forget, Molly has outdoor activities-

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,920
-and that Klara should bring homework to school.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,800
Start the coffee maker.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,440
Sure. Setting it on level two.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,280
Our homes are becoming increasingly connected and filled with smart devices.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,040
Features such as locks, alarms and - security are today connected to the Internet.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,600
And all digital systems has flaws.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,440
More and more home equipment is connected to the network.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,680
All this is hacked easily, which the criminals know.

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
We will test

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,440
if our hackers can take control over a connected home.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,000
-They have 30 hours. -I think we have to steal one.

17
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,360
What do you want me to do?

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,400
My name is Karl-Johan Lidenalv and work as a system manager within IoT.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,200
IoT means "internet of things" -

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,360
-and means connected machines and things.

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,400
That is a basic precondition to control the home

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,400
-without human interaction.

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,760
What will the weather be like?

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,160
In Karlskrona it will be mostly sunny.

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,640
Temperatures of 2-16 degrees.

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,400
Our morning routine is based on that we should easily get out of bed in time.

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,800
We raise curtains, and turn on the light during the winter.

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,800
We start the radio. Everything to get a awakening as possible.

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,440
Then our assistant informs us what is happening today.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,480
Let me talk to the store.

31
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,200
Hey! Already back? What can I do for you?

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,280
Add pear drink to shopping list.

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,200
-Roger. What more do you need? -Candy.

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,240
-Okay. Hope to hear from you soon. -It will probably be added on Saturday.

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,480
The big thing we have is the automations.

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,480
But the children probably use the assistants more than us adults, in general.

37
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,000
Best way to Bastasjön by bus is to take the bus 3 which leaves at 7.27-

38
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,080
-from the AWA road that lies 10 seconds from your location.

39
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,600
The journey takes a total of 26 minutes.

40
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,040
I know the goal is to get in and take over my smart home.

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:42,520
But I have not released information and do not know where they'll start.

42
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,280
The smart home consists of about 70 microprocessors and sensors

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,400
- in the house and the backyard. Karl-Johan works from home

44
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,440
-but has poor view of the garden and backyard, where the hackers are.

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,120
Now the hackers have to find a sensor without Karl-Johan discovering it.

46
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,840
-Found something? -Yes and no.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,440
-Was there anything that felt connected? -There's a sensor.

48
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,560
Is the guy an old soldier? There might be mines buried.

49
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,120
We can be burglars. Dibs for not being that.

50
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,280
-Are they home? -There are people at home.

51
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,840
I don't know what we're doing yet, but we're hacking a house with a gentleman-

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,560
-who has lots of connected tiny computers that controls different things.

53
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,920
We need to access his sensors in the garden.

54
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,840
They may contain secrets, so that we can connect to the inside.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,480
If anyone wonders what I'm doing there-

56
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,360
-I'll pretend to be from land inspection or an estate agent.

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,560
Some kind of office worker, because that's how I'm dressed.

58
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,080
Our plan is to follow cables in the– backyard that can lead to sensors.

59
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,400
-Hey! Did you get it? - Get this!

60
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,160
There's a fucking router here, so we can connect directly to it.

61
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,440
He went in as a burglar and scouted.

62
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
He probably found what we were looking for.

63
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,880
A box that probably has a control unit to the stuff we want to hack.

64
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,080
But he also found a router and power.

65
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,880
So really, we can just connect here like a network unit.

66
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,120
Pretty sure I'm safe. They will never get in.

67
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,120
Should they, against all odds, get in, they can't take over my smart home.

68
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,760
This is the time they lose.

69
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,520
Here we have the router which is the entrance to the network.

70
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,080
Everything is built together and integrated with each other.

71
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,120
If you want to get in, this is it.

72
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,680
It's the heart of my smart home and the most sensitive machine.

73
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,720
Here you see when someone has logged in to the router. It's me, hopefully.

74
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,320
More and more home equipment is connected to the network.

75
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:11,280
The lawnmower, your alarm or your baby monitor.

76
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
Everything is connected. Even the fridge.

77
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,760
All this is hacked easily,

78
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:26,080
-since most companies use the same passwords for the entire series of products.

79
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,480
which the criminals know. -And then take over.

80
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,800
You can turn off the alarm remotely in your home, if it is of that type.

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,040
Yes, we are in a 2.10-network. Now we have access to the inside.

82
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,600
We have found a router on the outside which we have plugged into.

83
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,160
It has a bad connection towards the rest of the house-

84
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,880
-but we have validated that it is the correct network, so we reach devices in the house.

85
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,320
-Check quickly and map up the inside. -It's slow, but I'm doing it.

86
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,560
Then we'll work from that.

87
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,160
I think I have somewhat higher security thinking than the average user.

88
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,440
I have a real firewall, or a real router with a firewall in.

89
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,400
I have my IoT devices segregated on their own network.

90
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:14,800
So even if you take over the IoT devices they can't take over my smart home.

91
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,120
I have rules in the firewall that locks people out who behave badly.

92
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,640
- Do you see the access point? -No, there's nothing.

93
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,200
-I don't see anything either. -Have they turned it off?

94
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,160
The network disappeared for a bit-

95
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,520
-so we think someone pulled the cord to the brain. Which is bad.

96
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,960
We no longer have access. The guy was probably paranoid and pulled out the cord.

97
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,640
We do not see wifi anymore.

98
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,040
The hackers have lost contact and need to find access.

99
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Jesper wants to steal one of the houses microprocessors. The clock is ticking...

100
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,920
We need to steal a device to see how they are configured.

101
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,800
-You get a pair of pliers. - Shall we cut it off?

102
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,720
We take the configuration to the hotel-

103
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,640
and make a hacker button during the night.

104
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,680
Then we can press Enter tomorrow.

105
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,920
That's as non-technical I can make it.

106
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,600
You're not filming this, are you? We'll just go and take that shit down.

107
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,040
A small circuit board on the different sensors that contain secrets

108
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,760
-which we want to extract. We need them physically.

109
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,200
I'll find a "Raspberry Pi" and remove the memory card from it.

110
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,040
And Jesper will find the sensor.

111
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,800
The car is also connected, which it wasn't from the beginning.

112
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,520
I have put in a gps tracker in my automation layer.

113
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,120
I load the car's position-

114
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,720
-and when the car comes home, the garage door open.

115
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,400
Jesper.

116
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,920
What's up? Had a good day? - Did you have a good day as well?

117
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,120
-Did you check that the power did not die? -Yes.

118
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,720
Now we have access to one of the networks

119
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,880
-and can try to get further in via that one.

120
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,960
We often have consumer products that are wide open to a hacker.

121
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,880
It is a danger in several different ways. We can be monitored.

122
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,160
Pictures and information can get into the wrong hands.

123
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,920
An example is watches you have for monitoring children and where they should go.

124
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,200
From them others have obtained that information.

125
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,520
It's uncomfortable if anyone else knows where all the children are.

126
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,960
It can also affect our society.

127
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:59,680
You then connect many IoT things, for example cameras, in a huge network.

128
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,200
Then you use them to attack for example authorities and newspapers.

129
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,440
Through your router criminals can take over Internet-connected objects.

130
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,240
They can order thousands of devices in thousands of homes-

131
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,520
-to send requests at the same time to a company or an authority.

132
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,160
A so-called DDos attack.

133
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,120
The company's system is blocked, and they can not perform normal tasks.

134
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,560
All this happens in silence without you having an idea of what's going on.

135
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,480
You can buy a network of computers in e.g. Russia-

136
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,920
-and pay per hour, as long as you are going to use it.

137
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,120
- Do you want some food? -Yes! We'll put it here.

138
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,880
Nothing has affected my work-

139
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,240
-but I have noticed that unknown devices has accessed our wifi.

140
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,080
A switch stopped working at 13.55.

141
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
I'm a little nervous, I must say.

142
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,480
-Why didn't it say anything about the laundry? -30 degree washes do not go to 100%.

143
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,000
They only go to 99%, and then it does not have time to react.

144
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,640
My wife...

145
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,240
-I'm interested when it works. -It always does.

146
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,240
I can't turn on a lamp without using the phone.

147
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,280
I can't pull up the blinds anymore, the strings are removed.

148
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,240
I remember there was a weekend ...

149
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,040
... when it was dark, cold and winter, and something went down.

150
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,640
All weekend I could not turn on the lights. He wasn't very popular then.

151
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,040
When the garage door went up and down at night she wasn't happy.

152
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,720
If I said it was annoying to go and see if the laundry was finished

153
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,680
-he'd reply: "I'll fix it!" We have a speaker that says:

154
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,440
"The washing machine is ready, the hot tub is hot ... "

155
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,680
We connect it and record a sound.

156
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,520
A lamp turns green when it's finished and red when it's not.

157
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,920
The washing machine is ready.

158
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,720
-The... -It's green now, so it's done.

159
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,880
It turns green during the second half.

160
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,280
-Is it finished, then? -I heard it.

161
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,520
My wife is not entirely positive.

162
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,720
She thinks I'm a nerd and that I do it for my own sake.

163
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,200
But it's happiness those times that I make her think-

164
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,320
-that I've done good stuff.

165
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,600
The dryer is ready.

166
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,040
Let me talk to the store. Do you have a recipe for gratin?

167
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,400
-ICA is unfortunately not answering right now. -Do you have a recipe?

168
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,240
But Dad, Mom knows, so ask her.

169
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes, then we'll try it. - Hi mom...!

170
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,480
Add margarine to the shopping list.

171
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,800
Add fruit to the shopping list.

172
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,160
Add salad to the shopping list.

173
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,000
The hackers go to the hotel to work undisturbed.

174
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,200
They notice that Karl-Johan's system is more advanced than they hoped for.

175
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,120
This IoT man is like a mad scientist.

176
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,000
there are firewalls and network segmentation.

177
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,840
So different networks for the different devices. There are different accounts.

178
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,480
He's really thought of everything. It's super hard to hack him.

179
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,280
We're trying to learn to speak "curtain language".

180
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,200
We don't know what language they speak, and therefore they do not understand us.

181
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,480
We can send data to them, however they're sitting there in the window and like:

182
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,440
"What? No."

183
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,640
There are a number of networks. We have access to two of them.

184
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,280
Inside are all the units which we want to control.

185
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,240
But we don't know how to control them - how the pool and blinds are controlled.

186
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,400
We have to log in to the other network where the "levers" are located.

187
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,680
We have tools, but no levers.

188
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,320
It's a sharp learning curve because no one has done it before.

189
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,160
What the fuck?

190
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,920
It just stopped working. It's very strange.

191
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,240
Have we said we can handle this? We're told you we'd give it a try.

192
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,600
-This... -Oh, how frustrating.

193
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,640
We want to trick the devices on the network to talk to our unit-

194
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,560
-so that we can record all traffic.

195
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,520
We hope that they then send important information.

196
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:50,240
We want to record when a device sends "lower the blinds".

197
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,920
If we catch this "request", we can replay it and do the same.

198
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,960
Then we'll learn how it works.

199
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,200
Now we've been sitting all day, tonight and quite late at night.

200
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,560
Jesper has given up. He couldn't bear it and needed to sleep.

201
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,400
The sound engineer and others from the film crew has given up.

202
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,000
Jinny and I are left and we have to crack this.

203
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,280
But we'll see because it's quite late at night.

204
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I've found some interesting stuff.

205
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,880
Three new machines which we have not connected to.

206
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,640
David has created an account that has synced to the different devices.

207
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,600
We have now logged on to more devices.

208
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,800
We are administrators on the entire network.

209
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,160
Imagine we are here, and so we find a small path into the third network.

210
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,640
But we have not found the net that controls the devices.

211
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,360
The plan now is to try to get in on the "mother server" that controls everything.

212
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,480
From there, we can control all devices instead of going to each device.

213
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,560
Instead of talking "blinds" we are trying to talk "mom" -

214
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,280
-and then mom gets to talk blinds.

215
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,760
If we can learn how to do that, we get access to everything.

216
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,920
I've probably found the brain. Here is the "input number curtain bedroom".

217
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,160
We are not far from it now.

218
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,840
Shall we connect a hotspot and just go from there?

219
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,720
So sick! We'll do it again.

220
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,760
-Radio: If I could ... -Fuck, that scared me!

221
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,920
-Why did it start? -Press...

222
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,200
Okay...

223
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,640
We can't count our chickens yet. We've only opened the garage door.

224
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,600
So now we're scheming, because we want to see what we can do.

225
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,400
Can we control the washing machine, the pool, the curtains and Spotify?

226
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,880
We want to take over everything in the whole house.

227
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,920
We think that we can speak these languages-

228
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,880
-and then we build a giant program which turns everything on.

229
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,160
It's going to be awesome if it works.

230
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,440
Damn, good job yesterday! I didn't have any energy left. You're awesome.

231
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,920
-I felt I couldn't give up. -Good.

232
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,320
-Check Keybase. -We want him to notice us.

233
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,440
I'll call you soon. I'll sneak around a bit.

234
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,880
You're online.

235
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,600
-I've started Spotify in Klara's room. -I was going to take the kitchen.

236
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,440
Do it. I'm running the death script now.

237
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,720
It's running.

238
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,680
-Run it in the kitchen too. -Let's go.

239
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,760
- "Epic Sax Guy". -Absolutely.

240
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,400
It's not that dangerously annoying ...

241
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,720
Let's turn up the volume.

242
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,640
Now it's "saxophone guy".

243
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,800
The garage door opens.

244
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,360
-Turn off. - It's not us.

245
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,840
They have hacked our home.

246
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,800
They lower a little now and then.

247
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,680
They're lowering. Damn. They lower, but I raise.

248
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,120
The garage door closes.

249
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:30,640
You can lower a little. It's very loud in there.

250
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,160
I've lowered now.

251
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,680
It was a bit disappointing.

252
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,040
I understood that they had gotten in and taken over the home.

253
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,440
"Guilty as charged."

254
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,840
Come, let me show you something. You're a hero.

255
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,480
My God, how many units do you have! A big compliment, then.

256
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,720
-Good work. You have succeeded. -Not without us pulling our hair.

257
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,480
-It was quite a struggle. -Shit, you have so much stuff. Cool.

258
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,840
I didn't think they would get in.

259
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,120
The biggest discomfort came when I saw devices online on my wifi

260
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,600
-which is not my IoT wifi. Then I felt that the battle was lost.

261
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,440
Yesterday we were here and connected on the Olympus network.

262
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,440
We had "access tokens" and everything, and could talk to your "home assistant".

263
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,960
We opened the garage door and lit a lamp somewhere in the house.

264
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,160
Was it opened last night? I didn't notice that.

265
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,760
Yesterday I felt very confident that they wouldn't come any further.

266
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,920
But I was wrong, and they got in.

267
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,240
The hackers gained a foothold in the smart home network.

268
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,560
They gained access and hacked the net that controlled all IoT devices.

269
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,960
From this position

270
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Suppliers must deliver safe products

271
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,240
-and have certification or labeling.

272
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,320
Everyone in Sweden will never be IT security experts.

273
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,640
However, we understand if there is a safety label on a product.

274
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,960
We need to protect our homes, so if you have everything connected

275
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,760
-not only the router but everything else, then you should have a secure password.

276
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Otherwise, the bad guys will enter your home, no matter how much you lock.

277
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,480
Check this out! Logged in as AppleStoffe.

278
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,680
You change a number in the password.

279
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,280
I really understand that it's not perfect.

280
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,040
We're going to hack Therése Lindgren and take over her online identity.

281
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,400
