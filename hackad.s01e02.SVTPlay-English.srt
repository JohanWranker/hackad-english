1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,840
Sweden is very computerized. This creates attack surfaces.

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
The threat is real.

3
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,920
Not much resources are put into security as would need to.

4
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,040
SVT has hired four professional hackers attack individuals–

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,480
and companies, to show how vulnerable we are in our connected society.

6
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,240
The basic functions of society are constantly attacked–

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,680
And the results can be catastrophic.

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,240
Can our hackers access an important company?

9
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,960
We have received a mission, so we'll run through it.

10
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,000
It's Helsingborgshem.

11
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,560
They have just moved to new premises with "max security".

12
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,160
A brand new building, nice lobby and everything like that.

13
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,800
Helsingborgshem has 1/5 of all residents in Helsingborg.

14
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,760
Businesses, health centers, schools - in addition to ordinary flats.

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,720
It's a large part of Helsingborg.

16
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,800
They have asked us to test the security of the building.

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,240
We have to get inside and place a computer.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,560
I've already been there.

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,680
They have good access systems, so you need cards, possibly code.

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,920
There's tall glass doors which closes tightly–

21
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,480
-So it won't be easy to accompany someone inside.

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,320
I have checked the entrances. We need to get in via the main entrance.

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,640
- During Covid, this becomes hard. - It will be a challenge.

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:53,040
Richard is the IT-manager and security manager at the company.

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,240
We have agreed to this because we want to test ourselves.

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,320
That is a crucial issue and it is very important to address it.

27
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,720
If we can help others see the importance, then it's great.

28
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,040
The mission is to enter the head office -

29
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,480
and place a computer.

30
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,000
Via the computer we can infiltrate the network and take over:

31
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,520
The register where protected info about the tenants is available–

32
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,440
And housing queue. Can they manipulate the system–

33
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,120
-And put themselves first in line?

34
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
For me, it's interesting to see how they do it–

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,960
-Because we have not informed staff that this is underway.

36
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,520
No one, except me, knows what we are doing.

37
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,840
I think "social engineering" - part will succeed.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But I do not think the network attack will succeed.

39
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,240
Social manipulation, or "social engineering", means-

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,320
- that a hacker exploits someones strong instinct to be social.

41
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,720
We'll send an email to the reception which says-

42
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,240
- that the consultant needs access to a conference room.

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,320
It will look like it came from the manager to trick the reception.

44
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,520
Linus has registered a domain that is identical to Helsingborgshems.

45
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,120
"L" is replaced by a capital "i".

46
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,960
It's impossible to see if the mail comes from the real IT-manager.

47
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,680
15 minutes before David arrives at the reception we will send the email.

48
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,080
They won't have time to call people and double check, it should be hectic.

49
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,680
-Let's press "send". -Yes.

50
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,680
–11.32 it was sent. -Here we go.

51
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,200
If David enters a conference room, he can place a minicomputer there.

52
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,960
Then it can call out to our server.

53
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,640
One of the most common ways today is via social engineering.

54
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,240
You look for a person - it can be the receptionist, or support.

55
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:58,000
Both functions are there to help visitors and customers adjust.

56
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,320
Nor can they question everything.

57
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,360
They need to learn to see through, be suspicious and think:

58
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,480
"Is this really true?"

59
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,760
Hey! My name is David. I was contacted by Richard Mauritsson.

60
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,440
With a tool bag, or delivery or whatever–

61
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,800
-You often come in in many places.

62
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,360
Welcome!

63
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,440
Once inside, then you are inside the shell.

64
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,000
And inside anything can happen.

65
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,640
I'm going to call him.

66
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,560
He has sent an email and has booked a conference room for me.

67
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,400
He said he had contacted you. You should have an email.

68
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,280
He has cc:ed me.

69
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,520
A larger company in Sweden discovered by chance

70
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,800
- they had a server that was not theirs.

71
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,120
That you can trick your way in via "social engineering" .....

72
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,000
One manipulates, says that you have an important errand –

73
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,920
- it happens all the time.

74
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,920
He said to me that he would be busy today.

75
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,720
I can't talk about it, but there has been an incident.

76
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,000
The issue is that it's internal –

77
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,280
-So everyone may not have been informed.

78
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,560
I can't really tell you.

79
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,200
So I get it, I was woken up this morning too. Hope you understand.

80
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,240
She looks at the email, at me–

81
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,200
- then they close the door and start talking to each other.

82
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,040
"Now I'm fucked, now I'm done."

83
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,520
The receptionist called me, who was a little unsure about a man–

84
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,280
-Who wanted a conference room. She wondered, "Should I let him inside?"

85
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,000
Because I had not sent an email I also became suspicious.

86
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,080
I did not know if it was SVT. It could be a confused consultant.

87
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,440
- You'll have to call Richard. -Perfect. I'm calling from here?

88
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm taking one last chance.

89
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,000
If she's just listening to my tone that I am nervous or insecure–

90
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,040
- She'll throw me out. I say, "Hey!, it's David. I'm here. "

91
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,240
She doesn't know Richard's reply.

92
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm a colleague of Linus Kvarnhammar.

93
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,200
Our receptionist was exemplary. She was insecure and contacted me.

94
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,760
I am very happy and very proud of that our staff has that insight.

95
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
Thanks.

96
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,360
It was "game over", we were "busted".

97
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,680
She called Richard immediately. He did not answer.

98
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,640
She called, called, then he picked up.

99
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,520
Shame. That's how it is.

100
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,160
It feels like a huge failure.

101
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,440
To have planned something so well, the adrenaline pumps  ...

102
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,440
And we didn't succeed.

103
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,720
Their new office feels thought out and hard to access.

104
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,040
They have thought about the physical security.

105
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,800
We had to regroup, me and Linus, and think differently.

106
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,280
When we were going to the new building, there were two addresses.

107
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,840
The new address, and an old one.

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,320
Helsingborgshem has two. We have been to one.

109
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,840
The other is at on Drottninggatan out by the bathing area.

110
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,080
Then we saw that it existed another office that may be alive.

111
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,680
- We'll go there then. I'm lost.

112
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,160
We'll see when we arrive. this rundown building.

113
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,920
Lights are off, it's dark.

114
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,440
It said that the office has moved.

115
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,280
- They're at Drottninghög. -They have moved? Thanks.

116
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,320
It seemed totally dead, initially.

117
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,320
-No wireless networks? -We checked if there was wifi.

118
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,320
Yes, here. One unprotected network.

119
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,040
I find an open network called Helsingborgshem–

120
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,560
And a closed one called Hbghem. Here's a lot of stuff.

121
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,440
When we sit there and hack, we see a person enter the building.

122
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,280
It wasn't totally dead then. So maybe it's possible to get in.

123
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,000
A person is coming.

124
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,480
It only takes a minute. It looks as if someone is entering the building.

125
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,200
So I went with her. She looked who I was and walked in a door.

126
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,360
- Did you see if she went up or down? -She went into a room here.

127
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,400
We Swedes are SO afraid of conflict.

128
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,480
We glance a little. "But what if someone is new?"

129
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,640
We dare not say, "What are you doing here?" It's something you have to do.

130
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,640
If you see someone you don't recognize, ask.

131
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,160
Wait a minute, another car is coming. Can you shut yourself in?

132
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,920
-Where are you now? -I'm in a storeroom.

133
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,720
The so-called caretaker is probably on his way in now–

134
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,920
- so be quiet and hope that that person goes upstairs.

135
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,560
Don't move. The person enters ... now.

136
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,920
I was looking for a place to plug our minicomputer into.

137
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,320
There were empty offices, some with handbags.

138
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,080
So I took one of the most empty, crawled down on the floor–

139
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,240
-Plugged it in and the network cable–

140
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,640
- and waited for a light to come on that shows there is network traffic.

141
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,480
No, I'm not getting a link.

142
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,160
Anticlimax. Could they have closed the network here?

143
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,280
But then it hit me that there was a reception.

144
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,000
And there was network equipment there. "What if those outlets are active?"

145
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,120
There I connected the small computer.

146
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,640
And the light began to shine.

147
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,880
"we could be done now. But I want to get it confirmed from the outside. "

148
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,360
I'm inside Helsingborgshem. Can you open your laptop quickly?

149
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,040
I have no way to verify that it works.

150
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,560
I just want to check that it has connected and then escape.

151
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,040
Then I hear voices outside.

152
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,080
A meeting room has been emptied of people who are standing outside.

153
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,880
And I have Jesper on the phone, to check if the computer is alive.

154
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,800
People outside are standing and talking. I have not locked the toilet door -

155
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,160
-So someone might open and go inside. and I'm standing there with a phone.

156
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,000
Jesper says: "Boom, looking really good. We are indeed in. "

157
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,640
"Found a domain controller. Good. We're really in. "

158
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,640
Yes!

159
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
We are on the right network. You have to try to get out now.

160
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,960
He can 't be there anymore, so he decides to play it super cool.

161
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,440
He flushes the toilet, opens the door and just walks out.

162
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,640
Opened and went out as if I belonged there. Turned my back to the people.

163
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,440
I don't even know if they saw me.

164
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,160
When I noticed that no one followed -

165
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,320
- was a really good feeling.

166
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,200
Now we have a wonderful time of hacking on the internal network in front of us.

167
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,080
Attacks on companies with important functions–

168
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
-Can have serious consequences.

169
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,440
One afternoon in February the sodium hydroxide levels rose at the

170
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,880
-waterworks in Oldsmar in Florida, USA.

171
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,160
Hackers had gotten into the system that controlled the plant.

172
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,480
A discharge of sodium lye in the water–

173
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,320
- could have led to catastrophic consequences.

174
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,440
Luckily an employee had the situation under control

175
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,080
-And lowered the levels again.

176
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,280
In May, long queues formed at gas stations on the east coast of USA.

177
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,120
The oil company Colonial's pipeline–

178
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,040
-Had been taken over by hackers which stopped oil supplies.

179
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,280
And in September last year a patient died

180
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,040
-When the hospital in Düsseldorf had been attacked by hackers–

181
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,280
- which made it impossible to receive patients.

182
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,520
An ambulance had to drive to a hospital in Wuppertal.

183
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,120
But when it arrived, it was too late. The patient had died.

184
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,840
These are just a few examples on cyberattacks–

185
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,280
- against important societal functions.

186
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,160
- Here come the hackers! - This is Jinny.

187
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,200
Jinny joined for the first time physically. Awesome.

188
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,640
She's an awesome hacker. It's going to be great.

189
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,480
- We have to go through everything. -What's our goal?

190
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,320
- We'll divide our tasks. - A wonderful, disorganized atmosphere.

191
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,000
You and I, Jesper, start mapping up the network.

192
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,280
Linus, you'll look at AD.

193
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,320
-David tried to organize the chaos. -I'll look at host discovery.

194
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Jesper just wants to go in and attack everything and hack, super eager.

195
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,440
Let's not be too hasty and think that we ...

196
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,680
False "assumptions" can lead us into a "rabbit hole".

197
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,800
Then we started letting loose in four different ways.

198
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,560
You had a list. A combo list, or what have you found?

199
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,840
-You found it with leaked passwords. -Yes, but I haven't tried them.

200
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,440
Often when you start a test like this on a larger network -

201
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,920
-It's pretty chaotic. It's nice to be able to work unstructured.

202
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,840
They use Telia as an ISP at least.

203
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,360
Do you have the port scan results?

204
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,240
It's on Dropbox, in the recon folder.

205
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,760
Our mini-computer tricks computers to connect to us instead.

206
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,120
You can trick them to send secrets -

207
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,280
-Which you can crack if the password is bad.

208
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,800
Install wireguard tools, then you get a daemon

209
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,640
-Oh, what's this? -That's a ...

210
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,080
Take user once.

211
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,840
Rava, then. This feels very PLC.

212
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,360
Careful now.

213
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,320
We tricked a computer to give us a secret which we cracked pretty quickly.

214
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,880
Now you're toast, Richard! Soon.

215
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,000
Now, cracked.

216
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,000
No - Administrator!

217
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,120
Kerberoast is up and running. It took a few seconds–

218
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,440
- then we got a hit on the Administrator account.

219
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,480
The administrator has access to all machines on a network.

220
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,480
There is a group of such users at all companies.

221
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,960
I'm testing the password against the domain controller.

222
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,080
If it is green, the password works.

223
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,640
If it's yellow, then we're domain admin and own the entire network.

224
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,600
–Boom! -Yes!.

225
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
It was a "game over scenario".

226
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,360
That was their domain administrator account.

227
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,480
So this user was the key to the kingdom.

228
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,720
- The housing queue is ours. -I'm in the queue, can we promote ...

229
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,920
-Yes of course. -I have already registered.

230
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,960
18.40, then it's "game over time".

231
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,320
Here's a list of all accounts in the entire organization - 850.

232
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,200
And here we have hashed secret, encrypted passwords.

233
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,160
To get them in plain text, we need guess at immense speed.

234
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,840
I'm going to do that with a script. Now it will start working like crazy.

235
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,240
Then we will get a file called "cracked".

236
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,160
There we get a lot of passwords in clear text, which will grow over time.

237
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,880
Now it's been a few minutes. We have cracked 78 passwords.

238
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,960
"Gris1234" (Pig1234).

239
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,120
"Vinter21" (Winter21).

240
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,800
Shall we run a bett on how many contains summer and year?

241
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:39,000
The most common passwords contain "summer" or "winter" and year.

242
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,400
These are all intercoms and all codes for all properties.

243
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,600
- Inside this system? -Yes.

244
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,640
So what code do you want, to which house?

245
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,680
If you want, then you enter Helsingborgshem.

246
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm almost sure that they have gotten in.

247
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,880
As an IT-manager, I have to make it as hard as possible-

248
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,360
-So that the attacker might choose another target.

249
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,080
After a bit of sleep and a lot of adrenaline we would present our findings.

250
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,640
- Can we come in? –Absolutely.

251
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,840
We had bought flowers to the receptionist–

252
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,600
-Who did a good job, because we were thrown out.

253
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,280
I am interested, regardless of the result.

254
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,760
It can give me an answer that means that I can put a new strategy -

255
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,080
- regardless of whether you succeed or fail.

256
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,200
So we got to enter this fort-

257
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,760
- which we did not manage to break into, at least not physically.

258
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,480
We had an envelope to show poor Richard.

259
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,160
Exciting.

260
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,200
An envelope with a password that we cracked. 120, I think it was.

261
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,800
The last page is perhaps the most interesting.

262
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,200
Really interesting.

263
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,880
On the last page, were the admin accounts. Six passwords that we cracked.

264
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,000
He got to see a lot of passwords in plain text.

265
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,480
It may be surprising how bad some are.

266
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,480
Passwords are easy to crack. It doesn't matter where you work.

267
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,960
People should remember their password.

268
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,440
You try to find a password that works.

269
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:52,640
He gets a few pages with usernames and passwords you don't want.

270
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,000
The password quality maybe wasn't fantastic.

271
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,960
The first thing that many think of When discuss IT is technology.

272
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,880
"We have to get this, and that, computers and technology. "

273
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,040
While in fact it's knowledge, consciousness–

274
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,120
Rules and guidelines, which are important.

275
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,400
It's 80 percent consciousness, knowledge, guidelines and routines -

276
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,840
And 20 percent technology.

277
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,280
We'll change password policy -

278
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,560
- where we won't change passwords so often, and require longer passwords.

279
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,320
Hopefully we can get people to use better passwords.

280
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,600
He was looking for his own name in the list of cracked passwords -

281
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,280
-But we haven't cracked it, so it's a compliment to him.

282
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,920
To find your own password there, would not have been great.

283
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,320
Then I'd have to rethink.

284
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:02,240
But it didn't end there. We showed him what one can accomplish.

285
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,440
If you look at this, do you recognize this?

286
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,280
I think it's one of our phase 2 servers.

287
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,760
-What is that? -Our real estate system.

288
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,880
It's our customer register and our housing queue.

289
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:25,000
- Do you think we got it? -Yes, because you have the interface up.

290
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,240
It was like a small joke.

291
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,800
As we established access, Linus was already a customer.

292
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,360
But he did not have many points in the housing queue.

293
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,760
Now we could actually give Linus 1337 points–

294
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,080
-But we held back.

295
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,960
So now we have reached our goals.

296
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,560
Their mission was to enter the network.

297
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,600
And then access the customer register and manipulate the housing queue.

298
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,800
The hackers never succeeded physically to enter the head office -

299
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,440
-But via an old office they got the access.

300
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,440
The hackers needed less than four hours to take over the network.

301
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,240
They managed to get the customer register and manipulate the housing queue.

302
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,480
The way your hackers entered the housing company–

303
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,280
-Will work in over 90 percent of cases.

304
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,280
There is no company in the world which one can not get into.

305
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,520
If these really skilled people want to get in, they will.

306
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,960
They have done this in less than 48 hours, and even less than that.

307
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,520
of course you are impressed of how quietly they have done this.

308
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:58,120
We had all the power to do what we wanted. That's pretty serious.

309
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,120
The Coop food chain had to close almost all its 800 stores in the country.

310
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,160
- Crime has moved online. - It's up. Yes, we have contact!

311
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
Yes!

312
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,920
We're going to stop somewhere. It feels as if I have done something bad.

313
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,680
This is extremely serious.

314
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,840
