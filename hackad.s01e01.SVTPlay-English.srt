1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,200
We have to find a good way
 to steal this.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,240
The entire budget, passes,
 business reports–

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,680
-Private photos and CV ..

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,080
Oh! passport.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,920
We have access to everything.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,800
We now live in the digital world.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,680
One of the chain's suppliers has
 been affected by a hacker attack.

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,400
More of our lives are connected
 to servers around the globe.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,800
More of our everyday activities
 are mapped every second, every day–

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,040
-By the big IT giants.

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Society and companies have critical
 functions in the major IT systems.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,160
Foreign powers steal
 research, development, drawings.

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Sensitive info
 about banks, alarms –

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,920
And the safety of the country
 is exposed online.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,800
We are one of the most digital
 places with exciting IT solutions.

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,280
But we are not as good at security.

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,400
SVT has hired four professional
 hackers attack individuals–

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,640
and companies, to show how vulnerable
 we are in our connected society.

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,400
The plan was to find things. And
 your findings must be fixed, urgently.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,680
The attack was extremely easy
 to perform. It's extremely serious.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,840
How easy can one map out your life -

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,520
-Or access community functions,
 companies? How to protect ourselves?

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,960
We use the internet,
 but don't grasp it.

24
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,160
Thus we do not know what weaknesses
 or risks we are exposed to.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,080
We are professional hackers, we
 help companies with their security.

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,160
We attack on order, to
 find weaknesses they can then fix.

27
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,560
- Here we go.....
 –Nice!

28
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,920
Headquarters.

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,840
We'll sit here.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,680
We'll hack people who come here
 to the room. There will be groups.

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,440
We do not usually hack individuals,
 so it becomes more personal.

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,680
They have signed.
 The cause is bigger.

33
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,600
They are guaranteed to fall for
 it. Our methods are perfect.

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,120
We use technology,
 psychology, their behavior.

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,000
We use things
 which are very hard to see.

36
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,000
In this episode,
 individuals will be hacked.

37
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,520
How easy is it for someone
 to hijack your digital identity?

38
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,400
We invited 20 people
 to a casting.

39
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,640
They only knew they were
 in a digital experiment.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,560
We were taken in one by one
 and had to sit around a table.

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,240
We had our own laptops
 and got to connect to the wifi.

42
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,880
We had to download a document and
 answer a form about the Internet -

43
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,880
And how to use the internet.

44
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,680
Before the interview, everyone reads
 and signs an agreement

45
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,320
-That gave us right to steal
 passwords and information.

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,520
All participants sign.

47
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,480
The question is if they grasp
 what they signed.

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,680
We do this because it is
 an order and to show

49
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,240
-How serious it can be when you
 perhaps compromise on your security.

50
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,040
They may have nothing to hide,
 but have forgotten what's sent-

51
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,360
And what they did online.
 And we can find that.

52
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,040
She is logging in again and again.

53
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,640
- Did we have her pass?
 –Frida Linnea Nilsson.

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
She's on Mac.

55
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,160
If I get root on it, she
 might get an SMS-code on iMessage.

56
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,560
She can't see us, but we see her.

57
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,560
But it feels uncomfortable
 that she's looks at me

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,720
- and I do't know if she sees me.

59
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,880
When he goes to Frida, I'll press.

60
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,920
- You keep eyes on Jesper.
 -Yes here we go!

61
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,640
I got this. You too?

62
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Yes, I got it on a usb memory.
 Here take it.

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,200
I also got that when I
 logged in first, the error.

64
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,360
I disconnected and connected.

65
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,640
I'm not here
 to participate in the casting.

66
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,560
I'll infiltrate and manipulate them
 to do what we want them to do.

67
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,400
Jesper is our secret weapon
 who sat among them.

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,360
He has been helping us
 hack them.

69
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,560
He looks at sings and gives them
 information from us in the room.

70
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Jesper has been our door
 out to them.

71
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,080
-But what to do now?
 - Did you get instructions?

72
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,400
No, I just rolled. I logged in
 with Facebook and got a document.

73
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,920
I work as an IT security expert.

74
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:34,520
I get paid to hack
 different infrastructures.

75
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,920
I got this.
 -If you got that then take this.

76
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,360
- What's on it?
 –Just a pdf.

77
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,120
That you are a group that does this
 activity together builds trust.

78
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,200
You are not alone.

79
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,240
If they open documents, and
 if they log in, then you do too.

80
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,840
Herd behavior and peer pressure
 make you lower your guard.

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
"If they did it, So will I."

82
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,720
Us doing things that we
 shouldn't, is very common.

83
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,880
We are lured by offers,
 We want to make a bargain.

84
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,040
If something is free, we accept–

85
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:29,000
-Without thinking about what the
 planted USB-stick might contain.

86
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,440
If you go downtown one night
 and a guy behind a fence yells:

87
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,680
"Throw over your wallet,
 and I'll give you diamonds! "

88
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,920
You won't throw over your wallet.
 But on the internet you would.

89
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,480
"Invest in this, we'll give
 ten times back. "-" Absolutely! "

90
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,400
There's a lot here.
 Business reports, a lot.

91
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,320
-Interesting things here.
 This is good stuff!

92
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,120
I think it is
 some kind of test–

93
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:40,560
-About what can happen
 on social media and how naive we are.

94
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm very naive when it comes to
 passwords. I am an ordinary person–

95
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,280
- with a common name. Who would care
 about me? I have nothing to hide.

96
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,040
You think
 that you have nothing to hide-

97
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
-But everyone has stuff to hide.

98
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,760
Students usually say, "It
 is just the internet, not reality. "

99
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,800
But if I suggest they surrender
 their phone, then no one wants to.

100
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,720
It turns out if you dig a little,
 everyone has something to hide.

101
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,160
Everyone has a friend with troubles
 , Everyone has been to a shrink–

102
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,320
-Or the youth clinic. You don't
 want just anyone to know that.

103
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,480
The hackers got usernames and
 passwords from all participants.

104
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,000
Most could be used
 to log in to other services.

105
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,040
Seven people infected their
 laptop with the hacker's backdoor.

106
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Others were saved by their
 behavior or anti virus software.

107
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,520
The Swedes have a bit left to
 equip their digital self-defense -

108
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,880
And enable their mental firewall.

109
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,400
Think about it, take a step back.
 "Is this really true?"

110
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,840
"Is this a person who wants 
 something good, or to trick me? "

111
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We know so little of security
 because we never got to learn.

112
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,240
Had we done the same with driving
 then people would have died like flies.

113
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,840
We're driving on eight-lanes
 full speed-

114
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,720
- without traffic laws, airbags
 or requirements on me as a driver.

115
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,760
Here I come in my Tesla,
 and we have aircraft–

116
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,920
- and suddenly, a donkey
 on its side. That is our Internet.

117
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,720
Jesper, Linus and Jinny, I thought
 that we should discuss plans.

118
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,280
I'm turning you.

119
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,040
My name is Jinny
 I'm an IT-security expert.

120
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:21,000
Dad took home a PC when I was
 small. I lived on a field.

121
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,120
Build computers or swipe poop
 - those were my options.

122
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:33,000
I got started with IT-security
 early and became fascinated.

123
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,240
The idea was cool - to get in
 where you shouldn't.

124
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,920
We have picked two profiles.

125
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,840
It's Frida, 26 years old.

126
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,640
And Andréas Lundberg.

127
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
Two people are selected.

128
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,280
We see how far the hackers can come
 with the stolen login details.

129
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,320
First goal is to take over
 their accounts and identities.

130
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,200
Second goal is to track them
 using their digital tracks.

131
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,120
Everything retrieved - usernames,
 password - use everything.

132
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,480
- Then we'll take Frida.
 - We'll take Andreas.

133
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,280
-We okay with that?
 –Yes I'll take the email.

134
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,320
I'll go Facebook
 and check apps and stuff.

135
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,560
I tested the password she entered
 here on Outlook, and it works.

136
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,760
Then I go Gmail.
 Is there an online client?

137
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,000
- I got into the mail.
 - Same password.

138
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Awesome. "Re-use".

139
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,920
We have too easy passwords and we
 uses the same on multiple platforms.

140
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,640
If I use it everywhere-

141
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,760
- then it is enough to hack one
 for my password to become useless.

142
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,280
The attackers check all services -

143
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,440
-To check if the leaked
 password is used elsewhere.

144
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,360
The data got at Frida's, that was
 her Google account.

145
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,600
Google account is often a center
 of many different digital identities.

146
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,400
Then we can reset the passwords
 on the services and lock her out–

147
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,400
-And then take over
 and be her on the internet.

148
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,840
I'm looking at her history here.

149
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,880
She was in the same group
 as a dude.

150
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,560
-Is that were you put your pics?
 -That is not where I store them.

151
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,680
Yes.....

152
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,960
So at 17:50 she looked up
 this guy, his home address.

153
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,880
She has since also befriended him
 on Linkedin.

154
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,960
Okay, I have a sick thing here. I
 know where she is. In Gothenburg.

155
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,000
Went by train. Shall we check
 her booking, when she gets back?

156
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,040
One of our goals was–

157
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,360
- that we would try to predict
 where she is.

158
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:38,200
Here are two pings. She was on
 the platform and logged in. Two pings.

159
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,280
We found train tickets,
 but no return ticket.

160
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,720
Here is a booking, and another.

161
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
There! The journey home.

162
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,840
17:11 on Thursday. Today.
 We can... today?

163
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,480
-In half an hour.
 - Shall we go and meet her?

164
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,280
She arrives on train 1083.

165
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,240
This was a goal
 we never thought we could reach.

166
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,560
But now we can, if we are fast.

167
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,440
If I'm right now,
 we're going to 2B.

168
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,360
Drive! oh fuck!

169
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,600
This is quite confrontational.

170
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,320
It's a bit of invasion of privacy
 that a TV crew meets you like this.

171
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,160
She's coming to 2B ... in five min!

172
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,640
Stay there, I'll check first.

173
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
This is crazy.

174
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,120
No, no, no ... Track changed. 4A.

175
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,400
Go to 4A. Now!

176
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,320
Up here, up here.

177
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,080
Wanna talk a bit? Has it
 been nice? You got up early today.

178
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,200
Feel like coming with us?
 Can we go that way, or?

179
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
We haven't been honest ...

180
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,360
- What was his name, opposite to you?
 –André.

181
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,120
You searched for him on Google
 and found his home address–

182
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,400
- before you befriended him
 on Linkedin and Facebook.

183
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,400
-I haven't befriended anyone.
 - He is waiting a reply.

184
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,120
I have read your history and have
 eyes on your phone, tracked you.

185
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,680
- These are my colleagues.
 -Nice to meet you!

186
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,160
Behind me was
 a hidden room.

187
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,520
- They sat there.
 - We hacked you.

188
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,080
From when you logged in
 to the website-

189
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,560
- we hacked your computer
 in iterations.

190
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,680
-I changed my password!
 -It's too late.

191
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm still logged in.

192
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,760
One detail:
 You reuse passwords everywhere.

193
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,080
God ... So ashamed.

194
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
You used passports
 to identify you online.

195
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,400
If we have them,
 we can identify as you.

196
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,720
I understand that you can, but why
 would you do that to me?.

197
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,520
Organized crime.

198
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,680
With your passport I buy
 ten Iphone and Playstation 5.

199
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:52,200
It's hard for you to say, 'It
 was not me. "I have your passport.

200
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,280
Last year, 1.9 million Swedes
 were exposed to identity theft.

201
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,960
In 74% of the cases it came
 via email.

202
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,680
About 200,000 Swedes
 got hijacked–

203
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,160
-Which can lead
 to very unpleasant consequences.

204
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,240
Those who steal identities
 are usually not superhackers.

205
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,120
They may be from countries
 where 10 Euro is a large income.

206
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,360
Can they use your information,
 use your Facebook, change password -

207
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,280
And lock you out, then they can
 contact all your friends–

208
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,840
-Who get Messenger from "you":
 "Can you send money?"

209
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,920
And if gear up a bit, then they can
 access your Internet bank as well.

210
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
And how much money
 do you have there?

211
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,760
What's in the salary account?
 Your child's accounts? Everything.

212
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,640
It is illegal to gain access to
 other peoples private information.

213
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,600
But here, everyone has
 given their consent–

214
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,080
-So the we can perform
 our attacks legally.

215
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,320
-Holy shit.
 -This is so uncomfortable!

216
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,520
We are really going to far.
 They have no idea.

217
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:43,200
It's an experiment. The paper stated
 what can and cannot do.

218
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,520
I do not think they understand
 how much you can access–

219
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,720
- via someone's account.

220
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,480
It doesn't feel good. individuals
 can't fend as companies can.

221
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,400
They at the mercy of the platforms
 they use, and it doesn't feel good-

222
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:12,760
- to map their lives
 and things that they keep private.

223
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,360
What saves me
 in terms of ethics and morals

224
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,120
- is that we tell the world ...

225
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,480
- We do this to ...
 –... for a great purpose.

226
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:37,320
We had no back door on Andreas'. The
 password didn't work on his email.

227
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,080
The challenge was to move on,
 so we checked open sources.

228
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,200
Lots of leaked passwords online-

229
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:52,320
- which we search for to see if
 his password has leaked before.

230
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,680
His email address.

231
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,600
- Shall we test Gmail?
 -Can you do it?

232
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,680
-We'll check.
 -Then we have ...

233
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,240
It says: "Your password
 was changed four days ago. "

234
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,800
-Oh, he got a code!
 -No! Was it a ping?

235
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
I have noticed some activity
 around my accounts–

236
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,720
-So of course I have wondered
 what the paper was I signed–

237
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,280
-When I went into the casting
 about what would happen.

238
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,800
It may be that we find
 any username or anything else.

239
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,000
- A restore address that is not Gmail
 -I'm checking.

240
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,720
I'll check leaks
 and sync with Jinny.

241
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,720
Andréas has entered a username
 and pass in the email -

242
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,880
-But when try it, we can't get
 around the two factor authentication.

243
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,880
We want a phone number for
 resetting with SMS-code or something.

244
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:12,120
We are also looking at if there are 
 accounts, emails, old stuff.

245
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,040
Data in apps, we don't know what
 happens to it or where it goes.

246
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,320
It is a serious risk,
 and a concern I feel quite often.

247
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:35,120
- Do you recognize this place?
 -Yes, I was here a week ago.

248
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,080
-Hey! Linus.
 –Andréas.

249
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
-Hello! We meet again.
 - You recognize him?

250
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Yes, we were at the casting.

251
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:51,160
We were sitting in here
 and looked at your behavior–

252
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,400
-And sent some commands
 to the laptops.

253
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,600
You seemed quite aware
 about this with IT security.

254
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,840
You were a bit careful.

255
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,400
That may well be true. I may have
 some knowledge of how it works.

256
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,520
The experiment was about
 hacking you, but we didn't get far.

257
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,440
So we searched,
 in open sources.

258
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,240
So I have something to show you.
 Can you login to Facebook?

259
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,760
It turned out that someone changed
 my password and logged me out.

260
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,600
You are logged out. We have
 hijacked your digital identity.

261
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Yes I can see that...

262
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,840
I was logged out
 because my account was hijacked.

263
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,840
And then you feel
 a bit betrayed.

264
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,680
In public sources,
 anyone can find your info.

265
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Your info leaked
 on the internet.

266
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,200
But they are in this account
 - an email and then live.se.

267
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,800
And that email address in turn is
 linked to very many services.

268
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Facebook, Microsoft 365,
 Instagram, Linkedin, etc.

269
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,840
When you get in there,
 then you can get on Facebook.

270
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,240
And you can log in to other
 services with a Facebook account.

271
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,440
-Very many services.
 - We have access to all of them.

272
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,560
It's scary how easy they get
 access to so much information.

273
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,040
It's pretty easy
 to hijack a person's identity.

274
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,600
What else? Microsoft 365 contains
 same features as Facebook.

275
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:08,840
You have email, calendar, files
 and family control -

276
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,400
- on 365.

277
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,560
We could map your whole family,
 add ourselves as a member -

278
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:26,400
And move money. Your Paypal
 is linked to the account.

279
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,800
It was a lot of V-Bucks from
 the kids playing Fortnite etc.

280
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,040
We could have transferred money
 to us. And your kids would love-

281
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,200
-If we adjust the screen time, so
 that they can play all night.

282
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,280
-That's what I want to control.
 -But we have control over that.

283
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,680
-Right. Now you have it.
 - We are in control.

284
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,600
At present, anyone can hijack
 your whole digital identity.

285
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,800
That's all this.

286
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,720
It turned out that I was hacked
 in many places.

287
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,480
It's terrible, and scary.
 I was in shock.

288
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:18,280
Right now I really want to change
 all my passwords really fast.

289
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,440
It will probably take all night.

290
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,680
The hackers were able to hijack them
 both and lock them out.

291
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,440
They managed to track Frida via
 a Gmail account, and surprise her.

292
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Your login details are today
 one of your most important assets.

293
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,040
It's the entry
 to a large part of your life.

294
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,480
The most important thing is to be
 fully convinced of

295
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,200
- who you are talking to,
 who you get sms or email from.

296
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,440
Before clicking on links
 one should be completely clear about–

297
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,600
- that it is the person or company.

298
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,840
How do you do that?
 Yes, why not simply call them:

299
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
"Did you send this to me?"

300
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,240
Or it can cost you
 a lot of money.

301
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,880
If we do not protect ourselves, the
 risk is that we lose a lot of money.

302
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:35,120
Usually it's about that. Or that
 someone is destroying our reputation.

303
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,280
OR blackmailing
 - then you have both problems.

304
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,360
That someone steals your identity
 and do things in your name.

305
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,720
It's like a burglary.
 You are terribly offended.

306
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,760
"Someone has gone through my
 private stuff, vacation photos"-

307
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,680
- "and emptied my accounts." Of
 you'll feel exposed.

308
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:09,480
The so-called caretaker is on
 his way into the office, be quiet.

309
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,200
We are on the correct network.

310
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,320
